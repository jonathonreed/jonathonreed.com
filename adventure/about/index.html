					<h1>About Me</h1>
				</header>
				<a href="../quotes"><h3>&ldquo;I would be brave, for there is much to dare.&rdquo; â€” Raggers Creed</h3></a>
				<p>I&rsquo;ve been adventuring since I was a kid but only recently have begun considering and working on this aspect of my life professionally. I admire a lot of different professional adventurers and most of them are experienced and skilled photographers like Chris Bukard, Callum Snape, Max Rive, whose work makes me feel more than a little bit intimidated. I hesitate to say it, but the scope of their imagery is perhaps beyond what I envision for myself.</p>
				<p>I&rsquo;m a skilled adventure-based photographer and videographer, an experienced writer and wild-at-heart traveller. That&rsquo;s easy to say and definitely is a large part of who I will become. But I&rsquo;m also uniquely skilled at and passionate about challenging traditional masculinity through my work with boys. So over the last few months I&rsquo;ve been developing a vision that brings those two parts of me together. Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve come up with, partly hoping that the more often I share and talk about this idea, the more clearly defined it will become.</p>
				<p>I guide boys and young men through outdoor experiences and feminism-based anti-traditional masculinity. The themes I explore in my photography are &lsquo;humans + wilderness&rsquo; (landscape images showing the interaction between people and the natural world) and &lsquo;boys + tenderness&rsquo; (candid and raw images showing moments of closeness and support between boys and young men). My goal is create a body of work from these experiences that illustrates connection and interdependence in places we are often told they don&rsquo;t exist. I believe that in a world in which division and isolation define both our societal relationship to the earth and traditional expectations for boys and men, this work is deeply needed.</p>

				<p>I have no idea who, if anyone, will look at this page. But just wanted to add in conclusion to get in contact with me if you&rsquo;d like to travel or work together. I love company and I wish I had more adventure-focused people in my life, plus my bucket list needs help to get done. Links in the footer.</p>
