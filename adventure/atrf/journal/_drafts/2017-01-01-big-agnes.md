A tent is a major part of any mobile outdoor travel, and for most backpackers and bikepackers it&rsquo;s a big decision. For us, on the road for six months straight, it was huge.

Our tent will be the only thing protecting us from adverse weather from the late-spring Atlantic coast to the Arctic tundra to the Coast Mountains and everything in between. Ontario thunderstorms. Prairie winds. Potentially freezing temperatures in the north. And not just us, but also our down sleeping bags (down loses its insulating ability if it gets wet), dry layers of clothing and extensive technological equipment.

For half a year, our tent will be our sole shelter, our sleeping quarters, our gear storage, our production studio, plus&mdash;and I cannot understate this&mdash;our refuge from bug season. As such it ranks among the most important parts of our expedition inventory.

Our priorities were dependability, living space and lightweight design, and with that in mind we turned to <a href="http://bigagnes.com" target="blank">Big Agnes</a>, the Mother of Comfort. Big Agnes is a young down-to-earth company from Colorado built by outdoor professionals who have placed it on the cutting edge of outdoor tech innovation. The company supports environmental organizations like Leave No Trace and the Colorado Fourteeners Initiative, and supported us in getting the gear we needed for this expedition.
