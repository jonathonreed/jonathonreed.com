Working on website development and the structure for our digital journal is the current focus. It&rsquo;s powered through Jekyll, hosted on Github and will be integrated with our <a href="http://astheravenfli.es">online map</a>. More to come.

We had some cake to celebrate our <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/asadch/as-the-raven-flies-cross-canada-cycle-tour/">crowdfunding campaign</a> successfully being funded and just finished our applications to <a href="https://canadac3.ca">Canada C3</a>. In between emails and meetings, we had the following quote sent to us from a friend. Thought it was worth sharing.

<blockquote>It happened at a meeting between an Indian community in northwest British Columbia and some government officials. The officials claimed the land for the government. The natives [sic] were astonished by the claim. They couldn&rsquo;t understand what these relative newcomers were talking about. Finally one of the elders put what was bothering them in the form of a question. &ldquo;If this is your land,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;where are your stories?&rdquo; <cite>J. Edward Chamberlin</cite></blockquote>

Warm weather is headed our way, and St. John&rsquo;s is coming ever closer.
