Two years ago I spent two months as an intern at <a href="https://www.greenschool.org" target="blank">Green School</a>, an international school in Bali, Indonesia; a place of exceptional community, sustainability-focused holistic learning, student empowerment and solutions-style optimism. The whole thing was made of bamboo.

I learned to surf and to speak (some) Bahasa Indonesia, I taught green studies and helped facilitate a boys&rsquo; rite of passage. I motorbiked, went free diving, picked rice in a paddy. Throughout my experience I considered myself lucky to spend time with exceptional, visionary teachers&mdash;and young students who were learning the problems facing the world, and already working to solve them.

I connected with Dali and Finn, who had started a clothing company to address education inaccessibility in India; and Melati and Isabel, who were in the midst of a campaign that later convinced the government of Bali to eradicate plastic bags by 2018. I also knew Ben, who at the time hadn&rsquo;t yet started his grade-eight Quest project, <a href="http://www.trihandkerchiefs.com/" target="blank">TRI Handkerchiefs</a>.

When I knew him, Ben was a fun-loving kid with natural charisma and a knack for making people laugh. Younger kids looked up to him. He wore his baseball hat backwards and shirts that were too big. Now he&rsquo;s changing the world.

TRI Handkerchiefs is focused on deforestation, habitat loss in Indonesia. TRI educates and empowers people to make sustainable choices in their daily lives, and donates 100% of their profits to grassroots organizations impacting positive change in Borneo, Kalimantan and other islands.

So I&rsquo;m proud to wear my TRI &rsquo;chief on this journey through the ecosystems and forests of Canada, and I&rsquo;m proud to speak highly of my friends in Bali working tirelessly to protect our shared planet. I don&rsquo;t know a lot about social enterprise but I do know that creative, youth-led, solutions-based action is a powerful thing.

It is exactly what we need.
