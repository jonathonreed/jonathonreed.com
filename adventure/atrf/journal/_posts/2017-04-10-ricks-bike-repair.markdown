&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, you&rsquo;re biking where?&rdquo; she said.

&ldquo;To the Arctic,&rdquo; I replied.

She looked at me like she didn&rsquo;t know whether to laugh or punch me in the shoulder. A moment passed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re crazy.&rdquo;

It&rsquo;s not an uncommon direction for the conversation to go. At this point I&rsquo;ve heard a dozen jokes about gas-powered bicycles, secret plane tickets and my hard bike saddle. I&rsquo;ve had people respond with laughter and cautionary tales and dumbfounded silence, and I don&rsquo;t begrudge them. 15,000 km runs close to the edge of most people&rsquo;s imaginations.

Contrast Rick. He looked us up and down, said, &ldquo;Sounds great guys, when do you leave?&rdquo; Then started talking about cadence, tire options and weight conversions.

<a href="http://ricksbikerepair.ca" target="blank">Rick&rsquo;s Bike Repair</a> is a local bike shop just a short ride from our home base in Kingston. In the months leading up to our departure, it became a constant source of knowledge, support, gear and training. Rick had guidance on every element of long-distance touring that we&rsquo;d thought of, and plenty we hadn&rsquo;t. More than a few times Asad and I had a discussion that concluded with a pause and, &ldquo;We should ask Rick.&rdquo;

I don&rsquo;t know much about elite athletes, but one thing I know is that professional athletes have technicians for their gear, their health, their nutrition. That&rsquo;s because when you&rsquo;re putting your body on the line for athletic performance, you want an expert backing you.

Well at least, I do.

That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s been like having Rick in our corner. He&rsquo;s an experienced cyclist, a master technician and a good friend. I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s many bike experts like him, but part of me wonders if he isn&rsquo;t the only one. This sounds superfluous but I can&rsquo;t imagine anyone else with his knowledge, technical skill and kindness.

Laughs and punches in shoulders aside, Rick&rsquo;s my base.
