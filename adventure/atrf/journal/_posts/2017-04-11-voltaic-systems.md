One of many concerns for us on the road, aside from polar bears*, is energy. For the purpose of this particular journal entry, I refer to 'energy' from an electronics standpoint. Between the two of us, we've got DSLRs, audio equipment, a laptop, and cellphones. How do we ensure, when the opportunity arises, that our batteries are ready for the moment just as much as we are?

We researched the issue a fair amount, with various different considerations and energy generation methods: dynamos powered by the spinning of wheels, solar panels, and more. We finally decided on beautifully manufactured products from <a href="https://www.voltaicsystems.com/" target="blank">Voltaic Systems</a>. We're thrilled to have them as partners.

Aside from two folding solar panels and the multitude of adapters for each of the different battery types we've got, we'll have in our bags two beautiful batteries which will charge from the solar panels or a wall outlet. Ready to get our thirsty devices some juice.

Voltaic Systems prioritizes being adaptability in being able to charge as many different devices as possible, ruggedness in keeping their customers going in the most difficult of environments, and sustainability in conserving resources in as environmentally friendly a manner as possible. All of these are high priorities for us on this expedition as well.  

Not all days are going to be sunny, far from it (though one can hope). But when the sun is in the sky and we're basking in those rays, we'll be ready to store them as well as soak them.

*We're not actually too worried about polar bears though people keep bringing them up lately.
