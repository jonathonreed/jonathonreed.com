One of the many challenging aspects to this expedition is that we are seeking to be both the athletes and the filmmakers. While many elite athletes have professional videographers accompany them, allowing each to focus on their craft, we&rsquo;re going to focus on both. This isn&rsquo;t unheard of and it&rsquo;s certainly not impossible. It just means we are going to have a lot to balance.

It also means that any gear that brings adventure and filmmaking closer together will make our work easier and elevate its quality. Cue <a href="http://polarprofilters.com" target="blank">PolarPro</a>, a Californian company dedicated to custom designing answers to the needs of outdoor filmmakers. I&rsquo;ve used PolarPro products with my GoPro for years, and have never once doubted their quality and dependability&mdash;and with an action cam, that counts for a lot.

PolarPro sent us a package of gear that will enhance our cinematography and allow us to focus on the adventure, knowing our action cameras and drone are safe and sound, and shooting the best quality footage possible.
