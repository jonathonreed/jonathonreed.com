We hit the freeway outside of Kingston as the sun was beginning to reach the western horizon. From Napanee west, our light was the early blue of the night sky and the dim glow of the laptop as we worked on last-minute logistics and coordination.

Toronto was blue sky and spring air as we walked to MEC, Downtown Camera, Vanhawks and Urbane Cyclist gathering gear and confirming details for next week. We picked up our Arkel panniers and parked beside a park on Queen St. to divide up items and work on weight distribution. A dozen people, seeing a row of bright red bags and neatly organized groups of equipment, asked us what we were selling.

"Nothing but we're buying good luck," we didn't say. "We'll take all you can give us."

We shot some gear photos thanks to our friends at 500px as the afternoon light dwindled. The sun set again as we crossed the city and headed for home. Currently working on shipments, St. John's logistics and picking up our bikes tomorrow.
