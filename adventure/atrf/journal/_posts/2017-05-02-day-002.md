Another 4 AM start, we are racing the sun, pushing ourselves and these new machines, which are almost fully loaded to the easternmost tip of this continent. The sun wins.

There is a strange and familiar magic weaving itself, an invisible force which I surmise is the basis of something like faith. Yesterday after our long stint at Earle Industries we cycled to a deli which was recommended last minute, only to run into the man who sold me my first bike four years ago.

We spent a fair amount of time in the wind, close to the waves, by the Atlantic Ocean. It didn't smell as salty as I last recall it. We're getting used to these bikes and all this weight. It felt too often that we'd be hiking up and biking down. The stretch back after pedalling all morning was more comfortable. 

We even spotted an iceberg(!)

When we settled in for a nap, it felt well-deserved, though there is a lot of work to be done before we hit the road on Thursday. I went to see [Arn Keeling](https://twitter.com/toxiclegacies) who came highly recommended from a dear friend and realized we had more in common than I had anticipated. It was an incredible chat and more on that front soon.

It was time to photograph our gear and repack all our equipment to distribute the weight a little more evenly. Another night of not being in bed early enough. All this will change soon enough, especially if we have the type of weather we're having tonight. (Freezing rain, brrr!)
