We pulled another late night last night. Were at a local art gallery doing a couple photoshoots until close to midnight and then spent some time planning and processing. Slept in a bit this morning (read: later than 4 AM) to recharge before getting to work on a bunch of loose ends. I feel like I've been on the computer almost all day, which is a shame when I'm blocks away from the harbour, a couple cathedrals and the provincial art gallery, the St. John's Native Friendship Centre and so on. 

I figured I would regret not getting this stuff done before we lose reliable electricity, but as I write this I'm worried I'll regret not spending more time outside in the city.

It's always good to have a reason to come back.

Tomorrow we head out onto our route proper. We've had a good base in St. John's but we are excited to start heading west. It feels a bit strange that this is it. A quiet goodbye in the morning, a bit of ocean wind and a short interview on CBC Radio (8:45 AM NST, you can probably listen <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/listen/live/radio1/st-johns" target="blank">here</a>), and the long road west. We start on the coast of the Avalon Peninsula towards Spaniard's Bay with a bit of light rain in the forecast.

I don't know if that sounds disheartening or not; I guess what I'm trying to say is that it's a bit strange to have such a low-key departure after so many months and months of preparation. Send some happy thoughts, everyone.

In the meantime, here's a sneak preview of an interview I'm working on and will post in the next couple days. One of my favourite shoots of all time.
