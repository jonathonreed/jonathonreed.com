One of my favourite organizations is <a href="https://nextgenmen.ca" target="blank">Next Gen Men</a>, a Toronto-based nonprofit focused on building better men through youth and peer engagement, education and empowerment. I'm working with them to bring a <a href="http://facebook.com/humansofkingston" target="blank">Humans of Kingston</a>-style series of interactions with men and boys across the country engaging in conversations around masculinity. This is the first.

He talked about his daughter providing a good motivation to get out of the house and get some fresh air. "My wife works full time," he said, "and I know it's not the norm but it's what we chose to do. I could have gone back to work but it's her career I'm supporting, it's her vision. I feel like gender roles are changing these days. I talk to my dad, he doesn't get it, he has a very different understanding of what a man should do for his family."

He held her close and fixed her hood and his kisses made her laugh. "I choose to love."
