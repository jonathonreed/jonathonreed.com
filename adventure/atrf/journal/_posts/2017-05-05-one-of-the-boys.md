This boy is hard to describe. Old and young in one body; hands accustomed to cigarettes and dirt bikes, and a smile that felt fourteen years exactly. Part of a 30-strong group of teenagers that built their culture on handmade dirt-bike jumps.

After he cussed out a sixteen year old we were hanging out with, I asked if they ever say they like each other.

He gave the other teenager a guileless smile. "We say he's one of the boys."
