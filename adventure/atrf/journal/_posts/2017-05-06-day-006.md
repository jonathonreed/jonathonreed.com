We slept in this morning, not because we didn't want to greet the morning sun, but the need for extra sleep was a higher priority. Rest is as much fuel for the body, mind, and spirit as other ingredients and essentials. We rationed the little water that remained and took off to find the nearest hydration station. When our wheels finally hit asphalt, it was smooth sailing. 

The difference between taking the Trans Canada Highway ('TCH' as they call it round these parts) and the smaller highways is stark. The road still bends and curves in all directions (read: elevation) but the chances of serendipity or chance encounters are fewer and far between.

It is more efficient as 'straight' lines are but, in a way, with less to report on. Sticking to it provides plenty of excuses to return here.

Thanks to Jonathon and his family connection to the United Church (there has been a Reed in the United Church as long as there has been a United Church), we've currently got a cozy and spacious basement in a place called Deep Bight. We showed up on the right day because the local, and very active, darts club was having their annual banquet. We joined in for dinner. (Jon remarked, "Seems like dinner was just an excuse for all the dessert.")

They're all still dancing, I think, but we had plenty to get caught up on and an excuse to wake up early to get to our next stop. More tomorrow.
