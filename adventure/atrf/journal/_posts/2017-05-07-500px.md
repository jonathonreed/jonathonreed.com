On this trek Asad and I are playing a lot of roles: endurance athletes, adventurers, ethnographers, writers and so on. One of the hats that we'll wear most often (other than our bike helmets) is that of photographers. Both of us have spent years with cameras in our hands, shooting everything from street photography to wilderness landscapes to afternoon sunbeams, and we have a shared reflex to document and share those details that colour our lives.

It goes without saying that a sizable portion of our route will be seen through a camera lens.

As photographers come digital natives, we've seen the rise and fall of a number of online photo communities: the early behemoth Flickr, world-conscious storytelling platforms Cowbird and Hi, the still-in-beta Made With Map, and so on. We know a dedicated photography community is both a rare and a powerful thing, as well as something easily lost. With that in mind, we are proud to belong to and partner with Toronto-based photography site <a href="http://500px.com" target="_blank">500px</a>.

What defines 500px in my mind, apart from great design and high-quality photography, is their commitment to photographers. They have countless features that are constructed to help every photographer learn, improve and succeed professionally. One of those features is <a href="https://iso.500px.com" target="_blank">500px ISO</a>, a dynamic, ever-evolving blog with inspirational photo collections, how-to guides, reviews and editorials. We'll be publishing a roughly monthly series on ISO about the intersection of photography and our cross-Canada expedition.

Our first post, which explains the expediton and demos our entire set of gear, can be found <a href="https://iso.500px.com/cycling-across-canada-photography-adventure-begins/" target="blank">here</a>. We'll let you know about future posts and in the meantime, you can follow <a href="https://500px.com/jonathonreed" target="_blank">myself</a> and <a href="https://500px.com/asad_ch" target="_blank">Asad</a> on 500px for photos on the road.
