Today marked the farthest I've ever gone on a bicycle in a single day. Deep Bight to Glovertown is 97 km, with more than a few hills in between. We again lucked out with the weather, enjoying the sun and cloud and relatively gentle wind. We biked through our first national park, Terra Nova National Park, which was beautiful and included a multi-kilometre-long hill.

Highlight of the day was at one point, Asad and I were together. Decided to have lunch in about an hour. He went off ahead while I took off a layer. 30 km later and still no sign of him, I started thinking something must be up. I swallowed my pride and flagged down a car coming from ahead of me.

"You haven't seen a biker with red bags like mine up ahead?"

"No, not a soul."

I explained I was missing my partner and he made sure my bike and body were alright. Then Asad appeared behind me.

"Saw you zip by from a convenience store a little while back," he said. 

"Like 30 km ago."
