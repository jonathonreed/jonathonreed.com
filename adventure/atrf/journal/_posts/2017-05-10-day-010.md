It was a s-l-o-w but early start to the day, which began with an elaborate breakfast and walking the dog around the pond. It is one of the most magical ingredients of a trip like this, how you can slip into someone else's life. On this morning stroll, I met an older man who asked me, "You from here? Where do you belong?"

I defaulted with the response of the geography of where has felt like home the past few years. But truth be told, you work your way up to belonging wherever you may be I hope. With a homebase somewhere or someone else, but belonging wherever you stand regardless.

This is a lesson the two rambunctious cats of our host take very seriously as they explore all the nooks and crannies imaginable. Today she set aside the day to take us all the way north to Twilingate.  

There were all sorts of surprises to the day, planned and unplanned, such as this iceberg. No sign of a wooly mammoth inside it. (Yet)

We were headed out to Twilingate to try and talk to some locals, ideally a few fishermen and we stumbled across the perfect people: a fisherman and a boat builder. More on that in upcoming posts. 

A sneak peek in two photos:

There are signs of whales everywhere here, almost as much as puffins.

Twilingate used to be a bustling fishing community but with fishing restrictions and declines over the years, it's primary industry is now tourism. Similar to a lot of other places, lessons from the land aren't able to be passed down from one generation to the next. Things don't really open up here for another two weeks so we're seeing a side of the province before the thaw. Something special about it all.

It was a full day with squid rings, mussels, cod tongues, the repeating fog horn of a lighthouse,, and, surprisingly, poetry. Packing up and loading our bikes for a surprise edit to our itinerary for tomorrow. More on that.
