We aimed to do 125 km of cycling today; from our campsite last night we had 250 km to Corner Brook. Only made 114, for two main reasons. The first is because both I and Asad have been kindly waiting on the other person to indicate they're ready to get out of their sleeping bag before we get out ourselves. I woke at 6:30 AM but didn't stir much, waiting for Asad to start unzipping; while he waited for me to do the exact same thing. Which cost us some time in the morning but won't happen again now that we've talked about it. 

Second reason was the wind, which started out as a headwind as we cycled 55 km north from Badger, and then thoughtfully died down just as we turned and headed southwest. The road headed north was edged by early-springtime birch and later on beyond the Baie Verte became an upland spruce forest.

Anyway, 114 km is a new personal record. We rode until the trees started reaching their shadows across the road, and now I'm cheerfully writing this from the warmth of my sleeping bag as the temperature drops below freezing again tonight. More sun forecast for tomorrow, which is great because we're going to push the final distance to Corner Brook.
