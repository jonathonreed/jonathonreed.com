Dropped by CBC Radio for an interview and then the local centre for cycling culture, Cycle Solutions, for a tune-up. That, combined with bicycling all the way to the top (speaking in terms of elevation) of Corner Brook for our first shipment of CLIF Bars and Skratch mix, meant that we didn't get out of the city until 2 PM.

Rode for a few hours just to get some distance but we're hoping to make a connection in Saint George's tomorrow night so we weren't in a rush to get anywhere. Some raindrops fell. The clouds came and went.

I'm not sure if this is possible but it felt mostly downhill this afternoon.
