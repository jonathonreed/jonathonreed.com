Left Sydney in the morning for a divided highway and tailwind that took us back to North Sydney and across the east side of Cape Breton to Baddeck, where the Cabot Trail begins. After hitching the ride to the ferry, sleeping on the boat and then only riding an hour or so yesterday morning, it felt good to be back on the road. At some point Asad told a local it felt like we were stretching our legs, and that was the way I felt too.

The skies were clear and the winds were soft. Even the 7-km climb of 250 metres over Kelly Mountain didn't feel like a strain, just a comfortable push and then long-lasting descent down the other side. We did nearly 80 km today and finished mid-afternoon, which for me feels like a good sign. Maybe we're well-rested, or maybe it was the wind or flatter terrain, but today wasn't challenging like the hills of the Avalon or the cold rain of Newfoundland's west coast.
