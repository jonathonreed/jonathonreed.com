Final day at the farm on the Bay of Fundy in Nova Scotia. The lilacs are in bloom. I spent the morning finishing up some more content from Cape Breton. You'll find them in the <a href="http://astheravenfli.es/journal/">journal</a>, with a few more stories on their way. I spent the afternoon practicing flying the drone, which I'm nearly done editing into a short video piece. Actually got lost with it at one point. I'm not familiar with the area, so the vast difference in perspective from 100 metres in elevation disoriented me. I couldn't remember which direction the drone was facing and couldn't see it in the sky, so I had to rely on whether it <i>sounded</i> like it was getting closer or farther away in order to get reunited with my rogue airship.

Another thing I'd like to share is an email I got today from a friend who recently turned 12 years old. "hi [sic]," he wrote, "having a good trip. i will keep praying for you and asad have a great bike today." I know it sounds small but thoughtful messages are wonderful to get.

Rhi is in the background of this photo. "Your name is Rhianna," I said out of the blue this evening.

"Yeah," she replied.

"But you go as Rhi."

"Yeah."

"Did you know that you could go as Rhianna?" I asked, trying and utterly failing at making a joke about how nice her name was.

She stared at me, nonplussed. "I don't get it."

I told her it was a joke and it hadn't worked out. She laughed and said I'd confused her. I offered her tea and, chastened, went back to putting honey on my evening toast.
