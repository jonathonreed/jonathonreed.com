It has been a few years since I've scared herons into taking flight. Five years in fact and I saw just as many today on our ride off Lennox Island to North Cape where Jonathon had set-up an interview with the Wind Energy Institute of Canada. Then back to Tignish where we're staying with friends of our hosts from Warren Grove.

We had a remarkable start to the day, our tent barely holding up against all the mosquitoes waiting to enter as we stepped out. Off to the local tea room and clothing store, where a wonderful woman named Mary made our breakfast sandwiches. She cooked our eggs in the microwave, something which I found astonishing.

It was a rainy day for most of it and we took the inland route rather than the scenic coastal one for most of it. Another reason to return.

Stopped at Shirley's Cafe in Tignish for a hot cup of tea and some lunch. Met Shirley who had the most beautiful purse. Turns out they were made from the clothes of her husband who passed away last year.

Mist rolling across some fields.

I've really been enjoying using the 35mm film camera thanks to <a href="http://downtowncamera.com" target="blank">Downtown Camera</a> so digital images from today are a little sparse. Will be worth it when the film roll gets developed. 

We are being hosted by the Doucettes. Lobster dinner, spicy vegetarian curry, rice, we even had help putting up our items on the clothesline, and then some more when a thunder shower rolled in.

Off to bed early tonight since we're headed out on a field trip early in the morning.
