Going to (yet again) keep it brief so I can head to bed before it's too late. We have a long ride back to mainland Canada before us and lost time to make up.

We detoured in PEI. Interest in the Wind Energy Institute of Canada brought us to North Cape, literally as far northwest as you can go on the island. A friend of a friend brought us to Tignish Run, the local harbour south from North Cape. The fact that we started work at 4 AM this morning means we're staying put for one more night.

We were lobster fishermen today. Skipper Henry said we could come on the boat as long as we didn't get seasick. We didn't.

Together with Henry, his son Simon and Simon's girlfriend Adele, we collected more than 800 lbs of lobster. I'm not including any photos, other than a couple shots from the morning, because the day really deserves (and will get) its own story.

Up until a couple days ago I felt pretty caught-up with the stories I wanted to share. Lennox Island and Tignish have brought a lot of stories close to my heart and those will be on their way soon. Ended the day with a warm conversation on the beach with our new friends from the west end of the island. Dispatch (day late) tomorrow.
