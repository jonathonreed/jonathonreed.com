With this trip it's become necessary to pick and choose our route, our detours and stops and our through-cycles, and it's always a challenge but we do our best to let serendipity mix with logistics to do what's right for ourselves and our documentation. Last night we decided to alter our route and stick around on this young end-of-the-gravel-road farm in order to help out at a work party.

We stayed tucked in by the woodstove in the morning, drinking coffee and editing audio from Lennox Island. Then in the afternoon, we and around fifteen of our host's friends cleared about an acre and a half of alder brush to make room for a bit of farmland. 

We have some more photos of that but I'm going to write about it in more detail in a separate post.

There was a kingdom of dogs that briefly considered an invasion of the kingdom of porcupines. That did not last long and we are sending good thoughts out for Fig's recovery from being quilled.

As the sun started to draw near to the horizon we went for a walk by Otter Creek, talked about forestry and farming and children. Then my friend Leanne drove us back to her place, stopping at another friend's farm along the way.

"This is what we got," one of the friends said, and I don't remember who. "Living the dream below the poverty line." Everyone laughed, but as the sun set over the valley beside Highmarsh Road, I believed it.
