This morning was all hills, and I was grateful that we'd started as early in the morning as we had because the air was cool and still. Still, I ran out of water an hour and a half before lunch, which was no fun at all.

After lunch we left Murdochville and (having looked at the route online) I knew that we'd have a few more kilometres of uphill before beginning a long descent to the north coast of the Gaspésie. Reaching this altitude sign was a great moment because I assumed (rightly) that they wouldn't have put up a sign if it wasn't the highest altitude.

Almost made up for losing cell service in the middle of a conversation with my parents. But not quite.

I figure we must have covered some distance if we saw avalanche signs and tidal wave(?) signs in the same day. Tomorrow we're heading in to the St. Lawrence River as we begin to bid the Atlantic a fond farewell.
