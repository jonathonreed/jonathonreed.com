I fell asleep late last night. Some of my favourite people live in Montreal and I asked them to show up and they did. Always a surprise. Some of them showed up with +1s which meant more questions than usual.

I felt a little bit like this cat named after [Laurie Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_Brown_(broadcaster)).

Today is Eid and this is the second time in my life that I have not fasted during this month. The same reason as the first time, I feel like I have written this somewhere earlier on this journal. 

The musallah I went to had the sermon in Urdu and desserts and delicious chai in the back. Great start to the morning, tired as I was.

We travel light and this beautiful bike of Jordan's which I borrowed since I'd left ours in the room Jonathon was sleeping in, ripped my sole pair of pants. #Sigh

Our incredible hosts, Ruby and Jordan. Not pictured: Sniv + Laurie Brown.

We had a tremendously late start after brunch and a long conversation (many conversations) over cold coffee at a café with a beautiful large dog as it's patron saint patrolling the sidewalk, blessing some of the customers and allowing them to pet it.

Our route took us to the shortest ferry ride we've had so far. A nice surprise.

Emotional recharge makes me feel like I possess a well-equipped toolbox with a portable cat.
