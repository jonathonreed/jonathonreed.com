We made it to Ottawa, which has been our de facto destination for the last several weeks, if not months. From here we recalibrate, re-plan, and set out across inland Canada, after having crossed the Atlantic coast into the St. Lawrence and up into the Ottawa Valley. It's still slightly hard to believe we're here.

No fresh strawberries today, although I did pick up an on-sale eight-pack of iced cinnamon rolls, which was either a huge success or a predictable mistake, depending on how you look at the idea of eating four cinnamon rolls in under an hour.

We met up with our friend Chris outside of Ottawa. Every now and then she would zip ahead and then dismount and shoot video of us going by. Each time, we'd be going at a steady clip close to 20 km/h and she would just change gears and charge by on her light racer. At first I told myself, well she's not loaded down like we are.

Then I told myself, she's just completely badass.

(She is, and here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAgGkuEGmyo">one of her videos from the winter</a> to prove it.)
