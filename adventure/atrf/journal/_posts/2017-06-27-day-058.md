Jonathon is staying in Ottawa while I quickly venture for one of my shortest visits to Toronto ever. Trains move a lot faster than bicycles.

I bid farewell to one of our wonderful hosts, David.

Rushed over to see my friend Chris and her parents-in-law who lived, magically, a few hundred meters away. Magic, I know. Breakfast, a quick interview, and a drop-off at the train station.

There were chores I had to take care off in Toronto, one of which was cleaning up for the Faith in Canada 150 Conference, so off I went to my favourite barber. I had a feeling of something/someone weird about to encountered and ran into my dear friend Vanessa Reid. She'd just returned from Montreal from the service for our friend Touloupe. Oh, the universe.

THe rest of the day was a blur, visiting family, having multiple meals, and being so tired I was asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow at my dear twin sister's. Felt tremendously worthwhile to munch on leftovers and celebrate the third day of Eid by surprising family.
