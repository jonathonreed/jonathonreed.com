In the morning, there was blue sky littered with cumulus clouds. After a while it clouded over, looked like it was going to rain, then cleared up again. We packed up our bikes in complete sunshine.

"It really clouded over," David said. "I thought you guys had missed your chance to bike in nice weather, but it looks like you're in the clear." I laughed and agreed. 

How wrong we were. Within 15 minutes the streets of Ottawa turned into I think the heaviest downpour we've experienced yet. It happened so suddenly I didn't put on rain gear, and poured so heavily that when the rain started to lessen I had to get out my towel to try to dry off a bit because I was so cold.

The rest of the day turned into perfect weather. Highlight was talking to my twin sister on the phone. Grant picked us up in a pickup truck because we were still many kilometres from his house, where we were planning on staying the night. Then the evening was strawberries and raspberries and good conversation.
