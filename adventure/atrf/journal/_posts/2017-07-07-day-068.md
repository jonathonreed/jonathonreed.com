We left late from Sudbury; I was wandering around the night before with my dear friend, harvesting audio of train tracks (didn't quite get what I wanted but *something*). We heard music from across the street and realized that the Northern Lights Festival was continuing. So we ventured over and had a strange conversation around meal replacements in pills with a complete stranger.

The music was incredible as was meeting a friend of Andrew's from my country of birth and speaking in Hindi/Urdu. A gift, a gift.

There was a whole lot of construction on the highway out of Sudbury and I was glad to turn off on to what I thought was the right highway, which was still horrible, only to find that it was not, when an officer pulled up behind me with flashing lights. I was headed in the right direction but&hellip;on a highway illegal for cyclists. Oops.

I won't write more about the rest of what followed because it is a good tale to keep to myself. For now. Exciting stuff, Asad. I know, I know.

We managed to make it through the rain to where a Catalan cyclist whom we'd met the day before had camped. Our first provincial park of the trip, first paid camping. Worth the waterfall sounds, the hot shower, and the flowers I would receive from a 3-year-old the next morning.
