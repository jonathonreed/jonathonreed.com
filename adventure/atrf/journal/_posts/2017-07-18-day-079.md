Another cool morning. I kept my rain pants on although it started getting warm, especially on the uphill sections, because I knew a thunderstorm was rolling towards us. Eventually it came, but we were coincidentally in a café with a cycle tour headed east while the rain came down. After that the terrain flattened and the sun came out. 

I'm not really sure about the geography we were cycling, but to me it was like I kept finding myself high above the lake, then cruising downhill for multiple kilometres. We bicycled through some blast sites and some narrow sections but for the most part had a good shoulder and some great views.

I detoured into Nipigon to get some groceries, where I met this woman whose name I already forget. She asked how far I was going and then offered me these little hand-knit socks. "They won't keep your feet warm," she said, "but maybe your heart a little warmer."

A nice little conversation. Then I bicycled away and promptly had my first flat tire of the entire trip. Two people stopped to see if I needed help, and it was funny talking to them through the window of their truck and car and knowing that they had no idea the sensation of air conditioning pouring out of the window onto my skin.

Camped at a picnic area. Still no cell reception.
