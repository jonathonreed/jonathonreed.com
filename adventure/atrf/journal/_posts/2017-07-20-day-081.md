This is going to be a slightly strange log entry because all of the photos are Asad's and all the stories are unrelated. We spent most of the day in different parts of the city. Asad spent the evening with the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BearClanPatrol/">Bear Clan Patrol</a>, a community-based group that patrols the streets in response order to protect particularly Indigenous young women and children.

But I spent the day at Cascades Conservation Area with a couple of new friends. Cascades is a series of waterfalls with intermittent pools of water, a really beautiful natural spot that only the locals really know and use. It was also the spot of one of the coolest experiences of my life. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/m.o.finearts/?hc_ref=PAGES_TIMELINE" target="blank">Matt O'Reilly</a> sat beside the river and painted my portrait. Call me vain if you want but it was really a special thing to experience and I won't soon forget it. 

Will be writing about it and sharing photos as soon as I can.

In the meantime, here are some beautiful tattoos photographed by Asad. Will be continuing the ongoing battle to catch up on journalism in the days to come.
