We left Thunder Bay with a tailwind and a very fond farewell to our hosts, the guys of <a href="www.communityspokes.com/" target="blank">Community Spokes</a>. Definitely the kind of place and the kind of people that make you want to linger, but off we went.

Around lunch time, I was ahead and came across a friendly-looking family waving from the south side of the road. I stopped and crossed to talk to them. At first I thought they were selling fruit and then found out that the fruit (and <i>fresh</i> lemonade) was for Asad and me. They had met Asad the day before, saw us on their way out of the city and rushed home to get a special lunch treat ready.

I swear cherries have never tasted so good.

I don't have a photo of them but Asad took a group shot which I will upload when it is online. Later in the afternoon, I stopped to take photos of the Arctic Watershed. It had clouded over significantly so I checked the radar on my phone and saw a huge storm rolling towards me. I layered up and hit the highway, and it wasn't long before I could see flashes of fork lightning on the horizon ahead of me. The thunder rumbled almost as loud as the trucks beside me.

No photos of that, although I did valiantly try to photograph the lightning before the rain hit, despite not having a tripod and long exposure. I (predictably) did not succeed. I eventually stopped at a gas station where I drank two cups of coffee out of the rain and we ultimately slept inside a generator shed.
