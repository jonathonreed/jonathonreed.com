We got up and got going and it was a beautiful day. We've been so exceedingly fortunate in SO many innumerable regards, the weather being one of them. Hopefully it holds for, oh just another few months. This stretch of the country is as Irena and Jessica stated (you'll meet them if you keep scrolling), "a mecca for cyclists." The fact is that there are very few options available if you decide to cycle across Canada and stay in Canada. 

We ran into the Portuguese cyclist Nuno. He is what the Spanish would call 'guapo' and the Portuguese would call 'bonito'. To expand further on this, notice his aerodynamic beard! Genius. He seemed pretty hardcore. At least his bell told me as much. Wish my Portuguese hadn't deteriorated as much as it has due to lack of use.

While I was talking to Nuno, Irena showed up. So Nuno took off and I talked to her and then as I was talking to her Jessica caught up. They had a great tailwind so I didn't blame them for not wanting to linger, we had a long day ahead. [Spoke and Stories](http://www.spokeandstories.com/) is the name of their project, feel free to follow along!

We will hang our helmets in Kenora tonight, before we fall asleep there will be spokes to repair, a stranger will give Jonathon some delicious breaded fish, another stranger will offer their garden, and I will prepare myself to bid farewell for a little while to one of my favourite landscapes and geographies in the world. Home someday for a little longer than this brief respite but it'll be a cause for celebration finally getting out of Ontario.
