It's almost 1:30 AM in Winnipeg after around 150 km at this point so I'm going to keep this brief. Bicycle maintenance kept us in Kenora. It was the farmers' market day so there were many people in town, cottagers and locals alike.

On our way out we got a photograph at Husky the Muskie. Somewhere, someday, I hope someone makes a Muskie the Husky.

As I crossed the Manitoba border, I ran into this guy Graham. I asked how long he was biking for and he replied, "Until I die." We talked about canoeing in the Yukon and hitchhiking across the country and he said, "Well how old are you, anyway?"

"Twenty two," I told him.

"My God," he said. "You're just a punk."

As you can imagine I adored that. Highlight of the day was seeing a wild bat(!) where we were camped past the Manitoba border. Then I made the reckless but ultimately worth it decision to take a photo of the tent among the trees. Will be sharing more about that experience and the needling sensation of having my blood sucked out of my body while trying to perform fine motor commands with my hands soon, via Instagram and Ello. In the meantime, here's the photo.

Cosy.
