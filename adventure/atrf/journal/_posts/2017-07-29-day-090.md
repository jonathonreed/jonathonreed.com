We rolled out of town a little later than expected, I was up trying to catch up on some (paper) mail correspondences while meeting some interesting folks at one of my favourite local corners, Stella's Cafe. A friend of mine had asked me to edit something time-sensitive for him and it wasn't till I got home that I realized it was a eulogy for their mother. When you leave yourself open to as much happiness as I do and love as many people (usually with great ease, seemingly) it opens you up to these moments of sadness. There wasn't much to write back; he wrote from a place of knowing his mom and sincerity. One cannot package and improve upon the eloquence that an honest relationship harvests. Something like that. Cat-like almost.

We quickly learned that one of our hosts had his bicycles stolen from his porch. Oh, Winnipeg. Thankfully, not too far out of the city we were distracted by a fruit stall.

We met some cyclists on the north shores of Superior and they'd pointed out a flower and I've been searching for it. It gives me an excuse to stop and smell others.

I love this prairie landscape in ways which are different to explain and articulate. Some day someone or something, perhaps myself, will be able to. Until then we will plot and scheme with maps and map-makers and those who own them.

Might need to get a little more crafty about it.
