This day felt bizarrely long. We had a beautiful breakfast on the farm we stayed at in between Bagot and MacGregor. Then hit the road as the sun was starting to heat the day. Then it kept heating the day. Then it kept heating.

After lunch we were riding in temperatures well over 40 degrees. At one point I stopped at a rest area that had a visible old tap that I thought for sure was going to provide a cascade of cold, clear water, only to find that it was bolted closed. It was like a mirage.

Stopped at a DQ to recharge and then hung out for a couple minutes at a gas station where we got a ride literally with the second pickup truck driver we asked. Incredible. So we hitched a ride to Yorkton in order to make a deadline in Edmonton. Regret crossing so much of Manitoba and Saskatchewan so quickly but I'll look back on some of the pieces that have stood out as things worth researching.

There's a thunderstorm racing towards us.
