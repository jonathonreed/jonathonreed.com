If you asked me today why the chicken crossed the road, I'd respond with something about the headwind forcing it to move across the highway. It was the windiest day we've cycled in. It was difficult to be upset because it is day 092 and have we been lucky. But we also moved s-l-o-w. 

It was a good excuse to stop and smell the canola.

One of the most important symbols is the [ensō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ens%C5%8D). I wish more people knew and recognized this visual.

Perhaps this is the flower I am looking for?

Some projects feel sisyphean in their scope and on a day like today, oh boy.

Still we dine at a deserted town called Sheho and meet Shirley and Tammy at the local restaurant/bar/home. Ukrainian capital. The streetlights have a few stringed multi-coloured bulbs. We wonder if and when those are turned on, if there is any dancing in the street anymore.

All of this is a gift and we are witnessing so much of it, even though we must keep moving.
