Writing from a kids' fort in the backyard of a rural Saskatchewan farmer. Today was perfect weather; after a really hot day and a really windy today, someone sent us some clouds and easy winds. 

In the morning, a pickup truck driver stopped in front of me and crossed the highway with two beer cans in his hands, which I haven't drank yet and I've decided I'll save to put in a fridge and enjoy cold. In the evening, another pickup truck driver stopped in front of me to ask if my bike was okay and if I needed help, and I ended up interviewing him for a half hour which I found to be very eye-opening.

Other than that there were birds, wheat grains, canola fields and a lady smoking a cigarette on her way to a grandson's wedding. The grain bins are as large as ever. The skies are living.

And we've had perfect weather for the entire month of August.
