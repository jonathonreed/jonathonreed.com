Today we grabbed a Greyhound bus from Saskatoon to Edmonton in order to make it to the city in time for Asad's flight back to Toronto for a wedding. I slept and listened to music and wrote in my journal as the landscape shot underneath our gas-powered tires.

We got to Edmonton and were picked up by some folks that we connected with at <a href="http://www.samaracanada.com/everyday-political-citizen/">Everyday Political Citizen</a> back in April. Good people to be with for the next several days. Plus a bird. Didn't take many photos because the company was so good.
