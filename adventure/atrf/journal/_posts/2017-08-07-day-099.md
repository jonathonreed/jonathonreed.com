I played three board games today, which I think may be a record and I also think is indicative of the good company I am in with my hosts in Edmonton that I would want to play three different board games. Except for the fact that my host's mysteriously strategic granddaughter Isla beat us both. Multiple times. 

The photo is from a chess match at 11 PM last night. Also memorable.

In between board games have been researching different pieces of Canadian history and culture that have intertwined with our route: <a href="http://astheravenfli.es/journal/2017/08/05/neys-pow-camp-and-japanese-internment/" target="blank">Neys POW camp</a> on the coast of Lake Superior, the <a href="http://astheravenfli.es/journal/2017/08/07/winnipeg-general-strike/" target="blank">Winnipeg General Strike</a> and <a href="http://astheravenfli.es/journal/2017/08/06/howard-farmer/" target="blank">a conversation with a farmer</a> in Jansen, Saskatchewan. Among others. Starting to set my gaze on the Yukon. Drinking lots of hot chocolate in preparation.
