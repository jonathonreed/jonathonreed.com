Made it back on the road today, with a lift out of Edmonton from my gracious hosts. Getting back on the bike felt a lot better than I expected; I wondered if I would feel out of shape or out of practice after almost a week in the city, but my muscles felt well-rested and I made good time throughout the afternoon.

Didn't find a great place to pitch the tent so I climbed up on the road allowance and made do with the steady roar of traffic coming up the hill. Briefly considered taking some long-exposure shots of the highway but ultimately decided not to and fell asleep instead.
