I'm heading out of Edmonton today, on Highway 43 towards Grande Prairie, Fort St. John and Fort Nelson. Asad is working in Montréal next weekend and taking a bus to catch up with me. Which means the laptop will be left behind in Edmonton for the next week—so our method of editing media and posting content will be inaccessible. 

So will be journalling on paper for the next week. See you then.
