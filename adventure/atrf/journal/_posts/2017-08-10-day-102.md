For a few seasons now I've wanted to check out the BuzzFeed offices, so this morning I met with my cuz, Elamin Abdelmahmoud, and we commuted down to work together. Every year for the last few years (excluding last year) we used to go for a walk around St. George Subway station. It is good, actually great, to see him growing up and not changing much but just being more and more of himself. Beautiful really.

Since he started working here, my friend Jane has hopped aboard as well from CANADALAND and CUPE. So nice to say hullo to her and some of the other crew members. I've had a crush on Ishmael Daro for a while. But I played it cool and I don't think he noticed. I did leave a note for Scaachi Koul. Not great a play as Jad Abumrad but gotta start somewhere, right?

My friend Amy literally works around the corner and so we met for a quick juggling competition.

Kavita Dogra is an incredible person whose work I've been following for years and we had a chance to finally meet and bounce some stuff around as well and take this photo before the security guard told us we couldn't. Little do they know!

Manager-on-site with some communication lights issue the TTC was having.

Interesting vantage point, I know I know.

I was trying to conjure up a laptop and my dear friend Ross LITERALLY walked into the coffee shop where I was deliberating over how to procure a laptop and handed me his. I was planning on knocking on their (old) office doors to surprise Scott and him. Instead I was invited to their new office space where we talked about commencement addresses, food security, children's books, and it was just ever-so-poetic as these moments all somehow manage to become. Just magic.

Tronno is pretty weird and I am glad I don't live here but have all these excuses to visit and be passing through.

But oh-my-gosh do I miss the textiles scene(!)

Sheer glee.
