One of the most jarring mornings as I wake up in Montreal North. I have it unpacked fairly and clearly where I am but do not have the time or energy to lay it on to here in words. We get a cab ride into downtown Montreal and the only thing our driver has in his trunk is ... a baguette. Folks, I cannot make up this stuff.

When I noticed the typeset and what it said, I looked for a moment to ask Celiah if I could take a photo.

La belle vie and it only got better and better until it was over and I was sad and glad that it was time to sleep. Montreal always makes me feel this way, consistently.
