We spent most of the day filming Wiel Prosper, one of the architects behind the gathering which has become hoodstock. 

My dear friend Derakhshan offered her kitchen to film in and was subsequently invited to the dinner my aunt had planned to thank the organizers for not only giving us access to but for being so hospitable and gracious, going above and beyond whenever they could.

Another one of the architects, [Amel](https://www.instagram.com/ameliazaz/), had a beautiful tattoo with the final verse of a poem from Ibn Arabi, it translates to "Love is my religion."
