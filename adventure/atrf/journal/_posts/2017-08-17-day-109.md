<a href="http://astheravenfli.es/journal/2017/08/17/dawson-creek-stampede">Writing about the rodeo</a> took most of the day. Met a French couple hitchhiking south who had bicycled up from Vancouver, then canoed the Peace and Slave Rivers over the past couple months. Felt a bit sad to see them headed homewards together, while I was just about to head quite-the-opposite of homewards.

Still, getting there.
