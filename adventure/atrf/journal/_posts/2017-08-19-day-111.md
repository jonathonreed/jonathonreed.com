Got a free cinnamon bun (yum), perused a pictoral history of the building of the Alaska Highway (wow) and got the news that my climb over Steamboat yesterday (tiring) was all the real climbing (hurrah). "You've already done it, honey," said the owner of Tetsa River Lodge. "Welcome to the mountains." I got up and gave her a high five.

I fell on the pavement yesterday so my knee was sore. The wind didn't give a damn. Didn't let up all day.

Met a cyclist who showed me some wild strawberries. One of the many highlights of the summer season in the right pieces of wilderness is wild berries.

Pedalled through to Summit Lake, the highest point on the Alaska Highway. Then did some exploring of the abandoned lodge up at the lake, this bright turquoise gathering of broken glass and overgrown weeds that was just super visually interesting. Will publish those photos separately as a photo essay.

I rode alongside the lake for a bit, pretending I couldn't see the wind tirelessly pushing waves towards me.

Then came the descent.

Met Asad in Toad River and we cycled into the wilderness together. I didn't photograph him but I did photograph the sky above us as we set up the tent together again.
