<p>Twenty-one, but only for a couple more weeks. Just finished a degree in outdoor education, worked the summer at camp and came home at the end of August in time to pack for the trip. I have a job at a private school for the year. Cross-Canada bike tour after the snow melts.</p>
<p>In the spring I printed 500 business cards that said <i>Jonathon Reed, Adventurer</i> and I did it as a way to commit to becoming who I wanted. If it was on paper, it was that much closer to becoming true. And that&rsquo;s kind of who I was at the start of this trip: a paper adventurer with a big hope built on either borrowed 30-year-old or brand new gear.</p>
<p>Young enough to wake for the sunrise, old enough to do it by myself. Experienced enough to feel confident in the backcountry, green enough to overpack. That kind of balance. But if this was a test drive, I think I&rsquo;m staying on the road. The journey&rsquo;s not done yet.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like crowds. I do like pine needles. I own two lenses, but one is currently broken. My quadricep is still not back to normal. I shot a full roll with my mom&rsquo;s film camera and I&rsquo;ve almost finished writing a song.</p>
