			<p><a href="../">« Back</a></p><h4>Day 1 - S1<br> Home to Quincy, MI</h4> 
			<p>Took us longer to pack than expected but shorter to reach the border. Customs took our tomatoes. We got lost in Detroit—that cracked pavement city with its broken-glass grin. Took the heritage route instead of the interstate, a happy mistake as the air turned gold and the clouds heavy pink –you wanna be in quiet corners and antique capitals.</p> 
			<p>Set up camp quick. Re-packed the car and it feels more month-and-a-bit manageable. Got coffee and donuts (free) at a small grocery store out of town so tomorrow will be an easy start. </p><p>We&rsquo;re figuring it out. Taking turns driving and paying for gas. Playing music and harmonizing and tomorrow he&rsquo;ll get the guitar out. Started Dharma Bums—we&rsquo;ll see how many books we get through. Got a phone and snapchatted pics to the fam. Gonna settle further into the swing of this tomorrow. Good first day! We forgot to pack towels.</p> <h4>Day 2 - S2<br> Quincy, MI to Lawrence, KS</h4> <p>Crossed four states today. Jonathon played guitar all the way through Illinois, passed in a foot-tapping wink of cornfields and blue sky. Detoured into St. Louis by accident but the bridge was distracting and seeing the heritage of downtown made it worth it. Kansas City was a highlight—the interstate rode up over buildings and bustle, we were on level with sky as the city swept over us.</p> <p>But it was one or two highways all day. Maps and music and blue blue. We&rsquo;re fitting and flowing from one action to the next, and we barely gotta mention, we&rsquo;re clockwork. </p><p>Didn&rsquo;t sleep much/well last night because I kept dreaming that I was speeding down the interstate, about to crash into cars ahead. Hoping that after day two I won&rsquo;t be dreaming of it any more.</p> <p>The cicadas were screaming when we came in, but they&rsquo;ve quieted now. Might be how we wake. Hoping to leave early because we didn&rsquo;t have change so we did&rsquo;t self-pay—if we&rsquo;re up and out with the sunrise, maybe that&rsquo;s okay. Dharma Bums.</p> <h4>Day 3 - S3<br>
Lawrence, KS to San Luis State Park, CO</h4>
<p>Finally hit the prairies. Left the campsite quick blasting Jailbreak. Stopped at the first rest stop to make hot chocolate and continue interstate cruising.</p>
<p>Kansas ain&rsquo;t nothing but big blue and cornfields, and always a thunderstorm brewing. Few small towns, none I&rsquo;d want to get trapped in. We&rsquo;ve been lying to ourselves about living in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a multi-state day but Kansas is wide. Whole lot of not seeing much. One fox, two deer, and finally, after crossing the border, the tips of the Rockies over the horizon. 
<p>Broke the phone and overheated the car, but we ended the day with the sight of huge sand dunes at the base of the mountains. The home of the Utes, who evaded European conquest for centuries. </p>
<p>Good day, long day. Throat starting to hurt and I hope I don&rsquo;t get sick before Dragon&rsquo;s Back.</p>
<h4>Day 4 - S4<br>
San Luis SP, CO to Great Sand Dune National Park, CO</h4>
<p>Arrived at Great Sand Dunes around sunrise. Made our tea and ate breakfast watching the sun creep over the dunes. Had to wait for our back country pass, but it&rsquo;s good we came early. List filled not long after us.</p>
<p>They warned us about the weather turning quick but it was only a 10% chance of thunderstorms so we didn&rsquo;t think much about it. Hiked to the top of the ridge and set up camp in a depression between two dunes. Had enough time to eat lunch and unpack before the storm hit.</p>
<p>Never been in a storm like that. Didn&rsquo;t last long, I guess, but time passes slowly with the tent walls pressed near to the ground, and sand piling against us outside, all howls and thunder.</p>
<p>The wind&rsquo;s picked up now. Not sure how we&rsquo;ll make dinner in this mess. Hoping it&rsquo;ll let up so we can sleep.</p>
<h4>Day 7 - S7<br>
Horsethief Pass, CO - Dragon&rsquo;s Back Pass, CO</h4>
<p>So let&rsquo;s see—the wind didn&rsquo;t let up. We had to pack up and move the tent and even then the wind was howling all night. Bent one of our tent poles from sheer force. 
<p>Left the next morning caked in sand, not quite well-rested. Hiked the dunes back in our bare feet, desert explorers! don&rsquo;t think either of us was really aware of what we were getting into. Badge earned.</p>
<p>We drove to Ouray, which took longer than expected. Attempted an unpaved shortcut which turned treacherous and we had to turn back. Thankful at least that it was scenic, a view you didn&rsquo;t mind seeing twice.</p>
<p>Managed to coordinate shuttling to the trailhead with a stranger named Doug—but it was late enough by the time we got there that we camped at the trailhead and started in on the mountain in the morning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been tough, going up. But mostly beautiful. Bridge of Heaven is aptly named—never had a place make me wanna pray like that. And after hiking over and across dried creek-beds, one right after the other, who knew how thankful and joyful the burble of running water could sound.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re camped at the foot of Dragon&rsquo;s Back now. All stone jutting out of the alpine meadows, it looks timeless and scarred and cold as a dragon. Today was an easy day—arrived here at lunch, but camping so JJ can get sunset pics. Tomorrow finishing the trail, a long day but all downhill.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ve been meeting the kindness of strangers—In the dunes, these three Colorado college girls in flannel and quirky sunglasses, they offered shots and smokes in celebration of being young and alive in a place where you got to experience sandstorms and walk out again with sand in your eyes and hair and nails, and laughter in your throat.  And Doug, who helped us shuttle from one trailhead to the next. Who gave me a book on spirituality and told me it was going to be alright.</p>
<p>My lips are chapped, Colorado is so dry. And it gets cold at night in a way I wasn&rsquo;t expecting. On the trail, every other stop is a chance to change layers. We&rsquo;re up above the tree line so it&rsquo;s difficult to judge distance or elevation change. Mostly I just walk step by step behind J, admiring the plants that I cannot name, and trying to avoid twisting my ankles.</p>
<p>The only sounds are the wind and the high-pitched chirp of what I think might be a ground squirrel or a bird. it&rsquo;s all unfamiliar country. I&rsquo;m still combing sand out of my hair. Got at least one blister. Did I mention my lips are chapped? Damn. But these are small things at the foothills of the Rockies.</p>
<h4>Day 8 - S8<br>
Dragon&rsquo;s Back Peak, CO to Boulder, CO</h4>
<p>Climbed down out of the mountains today. In the distance ahead of us they looked so small, just jagged edges against the blue empty sky. It&rsquo;s weird how you get used to somethings, how your normal changes. Things like—how being above the treelike for a couple days makes the pines look so foreign, all way too tall and impossibly thick. Things like—how crossing dried riverbeds after another makes waterfalls and rushing creeks sound thunderously loud. Like how bundled and shivering nights in the tent make the morning sun&rsquo;s heat feel like a miracle, or how days in the desolate alpine meadows make a highway with its tourists and travellers seem like the whole world along one ribbon.</p>
<p>And it was beautiful up there. Comping down Bear&rsquo;s Creek, the mountains were cliff and shale, sliding beneath our feet. The heady scent of ponderosa pine in sunshine. 
<p>Passing day hikers having a water break on the switchbacks, and having them pass us. 
<p>Finally unpacked from the trip, and it&rsquo;s all scuffed boots dirty socks gear and empty ziplock baggies. Drank nearly 5L on the way down, we&rsquo;d been joking about packing it out but we needed it. Blisters and ragged moleskin. Rocking a 6-day-bun, shoulder sun burn and sand-scraped glasses. Good trip.</p>
<h4>Day 9 - S9<br> Boulder, CO</h4> <p>Arrived in town late last night. Got a warm bed at Michael&rsquo;s, a friend of JJ&rsquo;s from last time he was here. Had a shower in the morning, leaving sand all over the shower floor. Ate pancakes. Ran errands. Phone fixed, car fixed, picked out a winter sleeping bag—lunch from a food truck and dinner at a Nepalese restaurant. Meeting Michael&rsquo;s friends and falling for Boulder one Subaru and sideways glance at the Flatirons at a time.</p> <p>And then the garden concert—Michael&rsquo;s old friend back in town playing a goodbye gig in the garden of friends moving away. Voice like heaven, loop pedal tapping. All of us gathered in blankets and borrowed sweaters under stars and string lights. The man sang, we listened. All breathless and laughing and soft. Intimate. Make all concerts that kind of hushed.</p> <h4>Day 13 - S13<br> Elephant Canyon, UT to Big Spring, UT</h4> <p>All this catch-up still in Boulder. Breakfast in Nederland, riding the carousel of happiness, &ldquo;so shines a good deed in a weary world.&rdquo; Silly (or not) that such simple carved wood should make us each so emotional. Hand-spun doughnuts in their cinnamon sugar dusting. The long canyon road back.</p>
<p>Visiting Jon&rsquo;s family friends, biking for ice cream with him on the longboard in tow. Whirling round corners, catching the pedestrian approval of all those Boulder sports fanatics. Ice cream never tasted so sweet. All the hover boarding, the shower, the warm duvet.</p> <p>Itzcuauhtli&rsquo;s big beaming (braces-full) smile when I told him meeting him was my wonder.</p> <p>And then being back on the road again. Boulder was kind and soft and quick, but to be interstate cruising, singular laughing again. Took a detour, the best detour. Up through Leadville (&ldquo;Great Living at 10,200ft&rdquo;) and across the continental divide. Missed the photo op but we had places to go, those too-quick corners and golden trees. Good music blasting. Got snacks and a destination, isn&rsquo;t that everything?</p> <p>Missed the sunset at the monument for a burned-out car carcass on the interstate, but Moab was cloud-crusted and blue by the time we got there anyway. Dry rain seems only fitting in the desert. Ate our PB and J dinner in the car, set up camp in the dark. Couldn&rsquo;t even see the cliff we were under, more you could feel it.</p> <p>Drove off post-sunrise with French capp and biscotti to hike into the canyons. Started on foot afternoon and immediately got lost into Lost Canyon (we think) which felt only appropriate. EC3 was near the only water source, God bless. No dirt for tent pegs so we lay matts out between canyon wall and boulder and fell asleep counting stars.</p> <p>Awoke first to find I&rsquo;d stolen his pillow in the night. Snapped pics of the Sleeping Beauty and made breakfast before he was out of bed. Today—hiked through and over canyons. Got distracted by photos and bouldering and what-would-you-do-with-a-million (haunted house, enigmatic French wine maker). All the riverbeds are sand. All the plants have thorns. It&rsquo;s dry and red, all cards and canyons and afterglow.</p> <p>This place doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p> <p>Finally reached our site when I thought we never would, the post sprouted out of yet another dry creek bed. Set up camp quick like we&rsquo;re becoming used to, dinner in the half-dark. Put up the tent at the sound of thunder but when the clouds passed over and the night stayed warm, we took it down for another sleep under the stars.</p> <p>&ldquo;Mais ici, dans la vallée rouge, les voyageur pouvaient dormir.&rdquo; (Désert)</p> <h4>Day 14 - S14<br> Big Spring, UT to Island in the Sky, UT</h4> <p>Easy hike out of the canyon lands and a long drive to the other edge. We&rsquo;re in sky country now. Past few days have bene up and down the twists and crevices of the canyons, watching the sand erode before our eyes and under our feet. Walking through history. But we&rsquo;re on top of the canyons now—the drive up along dynamite-scarred switchbacks.</p> <p>Watched the sunset at the Green River Overlook. A whole crowd of people came to watch it disappear behind the far edge of the canyon, entranced by the misty blue and sinking, settling reds. Shivering in the wind. Apparently there&rsquo;ll be a crowd again at Mesa Arch for sunrise. We&rsquo;re in good company.</p> <p>(Accidentally) camped in someone else&rsquo;s site (again). Sharing for a reduced rate. This is becoming our norm.</p> <p>And walking through the campground at night—the sun set and all of us eaten dinner, but do campgrounds, around the world, ever lose their magic? Always the faint smell of campfire. Constellations glowing despite a full—or nearly—moon, the Big Dipper, Orion, Cassiopeia. A couple playing cards by headlamp, radio softly chirping a play-by-play of the game, whatever team or sport it happens to be. An RV still with windows glowing, disembodied hands turning the page of a newspaper. And despite the minutes or hours (or other car parked in its drive), how familiar a campsite becomes. On the road, the brief home.</p> <h4>Day 15 - S15<br> Island in the Sky, UT to Arches, UT</h4> <p>Got up before the sun this morning to watch it rise at Mesa Arch. There were a dozen or two photographers already there when we arrived, all speaking their native tongues, amidst mechanical clicking of the cameras. It would have been beautiful (and maybe it was, for a moment) if it had&rsquo;t been so irritating and claustrophobic, and so many of them taking ugly photos. Regardless, the sun rose as it always does. Beautiful and calm and full of promise as it always is.</p> <p>We drank our hot chocolate in mittened hands and ate biscotti close on the cliff&rsquo;s edge. Left early to try and beat the line at Arches, all those weird geological formations calling our name.</p> <p>Sun rising on the ride out, we watered watched the Wizard* trying to fly, blinded and lost as his Utopia hit the edge. Pulled up long enough to make sure he was okay and to send a wish that his car would drive again, but what could we do? No space even for hitchhikers.</p> <p>At Arches now, and have been doing small hikes all day. Out here and up there, through the orange sand and warm rock. All these bizarre tunnels carved into walls of stone, thinned and smoothed over time.</p> <p>We&rsquo;re two of hundreds of thousands that will pass through these lands. Along the trail rocks and trees are worn smooth from the millions of hands that have touched them before us, also looking for balance or relief. We went barefoot along the sandy path of one of the trails, so at least if we are not remembered by the canyons and fins, the other passers-through will remember long enough to wonder.</p> <p>Unshowered, dust turning my ankles a splotchy reddish brown. Tanned during the day and shivering in the tent at night. Nails cut to the quick after days in the wild with them breaking. Only young people on the trails by decades if not generations. All our peers back in class and only the elderly on tours surround us—liver spots and sun visors and varicose veins. <p>Part of me hoping I&rsquo;ll be like them, all my life: called to the open road and travelled trail. Part of me horrified at the prospect of getting old.</p> <p>*The Wizard: caretaker of our million-dollar haunted house. Our guy from Canyonlands one end to the other.</p> <h4>Day 17 - S17<br> Coyote Gulch, UT</h4> <p>We went to the Double Arch for sunset. The last arch we&rsquo;d seen, and by far the most beautiful. Towering spans of stone, looking and feeling like a cathedral awaiting a concert. All rough and jutting stone, catching those trying to climb her off balance. A drop on the other side of the arch, enough to force some to stay on their hands and knees.</p> <p>We out-waited the crowds. Camera in hand, letting the arch fill with the eerie and and aching red of the desert.</p> <p>As we left the park, we passed car after car pulled over to the shoulder. All these people stood outside, half-breathless, eyes filling with glow as the full moon rose over the Garden of Eden.</p> <p>Waited until late afterglow faded out of the canyons and headed to Moab for greasy 24h Mexican food (and to pick up JJ&rsquo;s sleeping bag). Odd-not-odd being in town, surrounded by adventurers and ordinary folk while still salty with the desert&rsquo;s red dust.</p> <p>Got back to camp to find our tent hand&rsquo;t been towed, and no fine despite us (&lsquo;forgetting&rsquo;) to pay the fee. On trend for our jailbreak escapes, we packed and left just after sunrise. Gas light came on almost as soon as we left the campsite, and its as another 25 km to the closest gas station. Thankful for the long, winding downhill slope, I kept the car in cruise and let Jon distract me with trap music and dedication songs.</p> <p>Halfway to the ground, an indistinguishable marking in the sky transformed into a brightly coloured hot air balloon, making its own journey to the Island in the Sky. We re-hit the interstate, cutting through the utter desolation of the Utah desert. No ranches now, or towns or houses. Just scrubland and sand and strange twisted red stone lifting into the air.</p> <p>We passed through Capitol Reef, one national park I was glad we were&rsquo;t staying at—though I was glad of the original Mormon settlers who played fruit orchards along the creek bed. I ripped a hole in my shorts running through the gate to grab handfuls of apples and pears.</p> <p>Planned our trip (or re-planned, changing only the trailhead) with a ranger at the visitor&rsquo;s centre, grabbed a map and rode the washboard road to the trailhead.</p> <p>Saw a coyote at Coyote Gulch. Ears twitching, tail dark. Light-footed and slight and inquisitive.</p> <p>Of all the parks and places so far, this one has been my favourite. The first few miles out of the trailhead were nothing spectacular—scrubland, desert, dried riverbeds and red rock. All things that had become so ordinary out here in the desert. But once into the gulch—goddamn. It was a absolutely awe-inspiring. The creek gurgling over red sand, the canyon walls curving up into the sky. Marching along the bottom of the creek with the willows and reeds, and hearing our voices echo-echo-echo. We set up camp, and went exploring with a day pack, walking amiably, kicking water as we went.</p> <p>Arrived at Jacob Hamblin Arch to find near a dozen tents set up in its shadow. But what an arch. Bigger, more breathtaking than all 2,000 at Arches. Climbed to the top of its collapsed rubble and could feel the soft canyon breeze, see the river flower on either side. Hear the murmuring echo of the voices of the campers below. Got back to camp to find a surprisingly diurnal coyote had ravaged our food bag. Made dinner (sad) of scraps and snacks from our day pack, and re-planned our route. We learn from experience, and roll with the punches. So it goes. <p>Purified the water, packed bags. Ready to leave with the sun&rsquo;s light.</p> <p>But our camp is charming, and the river quietly bubbling behind us. Stars and crickets and stoic canyon walls surround.</p> <h4>Day 18 - S18<br> Escalante, UT</h4> <p>Drove out, hiked out of the gulch. Stopped at an RV park on the edge of town with cheaper rates than the state park, plus showers and laundry. Spent the day getting clean, re-organizing, Jon writing/posting stories, me finally getting started on postcards.</p> <p>Made bannock with jam in the wok. Sipping hot chocolate. Both of us quietly, happily journaling, though on a wider picnic table than our rock of last night.</p> <p>Going to curl up in the tent tonight, in our snuggle plush down sleeping bags, and watch San Andreas. That kind of camping. The sun has gone down now, the sky a dark murky blue. Rss have lights, glowing around us. There&rsquo;s a faint smell weed lingering in the air. Half a constellation peeking over the horizon.</p>
<h4>Day 20 - S20<br>
Bryce Canyon NP, UT</h4>
<p>They&rsquo;re called hoodoos. After Arches and Cayonlands, I thought I knew what to expect from the Utah desert, thought the red sandstone formations would bore me.</p>
 <p>But not these.</p>
<p>The sand here is orange, not red. That somehow makes it look even more alien, with the great swaths of white sand, and the hoodoos - bizarrely eroded and curiously symmetrical columns, jutting out of the canyon walls. Filing together to form an amphitheatre.</p>
<p>Yesterday it was the beating Utah desert sun. We hiked down, amongst the hoodoos, chugging water and gathering tan lines, walked the switchbacks and got held up behind herds of horses—their elderly riders smiling down at us as they rode past. Nodded amiably at all the other hikers but breathed deeper when we got away form the hordes at the trailhead and down Wall St., into the quiet of the desert.</p>
<p>Yesterday was what you&rsquo;d expect from this kind of place: all sun glowing into the rock, dust clinging to our ankles. Though there were clouds, the sky lit up in fire at sunset - gold and pink and purple.</p>
<p>But today it&rsquo;s been cold and clammy. Rain off and on but no thunderstorms, thank goodness. Hiked the Fairyland Land loop this morning before the clouds settled in but it was different in the cold—the sun hidden, as the spines and arches looking flat instead of glowing orange.</p>
<p>Tried to make it back to camp before the rain but there was no helping it. Unsuccessfully hitchhiked beside the highway, trying to catch a list back to our campsite. The back of my hands were painfully cold by the time we made it back to our warm dry clothes and comfy camp shoes.</p>
<h4>Day 21 - S21<br>
Bryce Canyon NP, UT</h4>
<p>Second day in the rain. Surprising that we&rsquo;ve lasted this far in the trip without any bad weather—we&rsquo;ve always been skirting the edge of storms, but they&rsquo;ve all passed us by, just hitting us with wind and cloud, sometimes thunder, but never more than a couple groups of rain. But this—</p>
<p>Oh this has been fun.</p>
<p>Woke this morning to find fog heavy on the ground and thick through the trees, drizzle still coming down. Test fly soaked but our down sleeping bags still so snuggly and warm. Made bannock with jam and hot chocolate for breakfast because rainy days call for that sort of thing. Bundled up in layers, with electronics all in hand, we headed off to the visitor&rsquo;s centre for heat and shelter and outlets.</p>
<p>Seemed like the whole campground had gathered there also, wandering aimlessly through the exhibit, poling into the theatre, spilling out of the gift-shop.</p>
<p>We sat by the bathrooms, as much out of the way of the hordes as we could get. Edited stories, checked photos, wrote postcards. The morning passed.</p>
<p>We drove to a scenic viewpoint to make lunch but it was a drive through the fog, to the fog. All was a thick and cloudy wall of white. Glad we&rsquo;d done our adventuring down the canyon the two days previous, because in the cold and gloom, even if you wanted to go outside, there was nothing to see.</p>
<p>We passed soaking wet and (at least they looked) miserable hikers along the highway, and while I admired their fortitude, it was not something/where I wanted to be.</p>
<p>We drove back to camp, made tea and donuts, watched a movie in the shelter of the car. Small part of me feels silly, a waste of a day—but we came out here. We can spend the day any damn way we like. And in this cold and damp, there&rsquo;s no other way I&rsquo;d want to spend it. Wishing we had a blanket though. Or slippers.</p>
<h4>Day 22 - S22<br>
Bryce Canyon NP, UT to Zion National Park, UT</h4>
<p>By our calculations, it rained for 44h. Still coming down hard when we woke this morning and that made wanting to get up, to get out of the tent, very hard indeed. Once the rain slowed to a drizzle, we packed up our (soaking wet) gear, made quick French capps, grabbed some biscotti and rolled out.</p></p>Midway along the drive, the clouds broke, the rain stopped.</p></p>We had lunch in a small town right by the Arizona border, hoping to find a camera repairman to fit JJ&rsquo;s wobbly lens. No luck there, but she cleaned the lenses, sold him some batteries for the film camera, promised her his camera wouldn&rsquo;t fall apart. Small encouragements.</p></p>The park where we had lunch had a full river running through the road bordering it—evidence, if we needed it, that they aren&rsquo;t used to heavy, constant rain in these parts. The roads don&rsquo;t have any storm grates, but there were a couple drivers that looked nonplussed, splashing through the orange torrent without hesitation.</p></p>We weren&rsquo;t the only ones at the park—shortly after we arrived, a battered truck pulled up and thick grizzled mass of a man, tanned leather face, slight stoop, hands like baseball gloves, hopped out. Predictably dressed in plaid and denim. And then—behind him, his teensy grandson (?), easily 1/5 his size, and wearing matching plaid and denim, and his hand all but disappeared into the grip of the larger.</p>
<h4>Day 23 - S23<br>
Zion National Park, UT</h4>
<p>I love watching campgrounds come to life. By the time I crawled out of the tent—the light shining through finally trumping the warmth of my bag—the neighbours to the left were bundling their baby into its tuque and sleeping bag (they&rsquo;d all been up by 5 or 6, tent walls aren&rsquo;t so thick to hide those cries) and taking pictures. They&rsquo;ll go into a photo book or an album on FB and someday some teen will stare at them, wishing they could remember.</p></p>I started wiping down the table, getting out all the breakfast things. Neighbour to the right was doing the same. All across the campground, layered-up hikers in their boots and tall socks, campers in their slightly-too-big-sweaters (things they&rsquo;d never wear in the real world). I heard rustling from the tent and Jonjon crawls out after me.</p></p>We walk to the bathrooms, passing whole groups of campers sat in silent circles, holding their warm drinks in hand. Pass an elderly couple, the woman shivering at the table-clothed table as the other stands to make pancakes.</p></p>In the bathroom, a blonde girl tugs at her hair and then yanks her ball cap back on, and we joke about long days without showering and losing hair ties.</p></p>It&rsquo;s cold enough (and damp, after last night&rsquo;s rain) that people are moving slowly this morning. But by the time we have hot chocolate in hand and have eaten our breakfast, other campers are wishing us a &lsquo;good morning&rsquo; as they pass on the road, and the sun is reflecting on the canyon walls around us, ready to ease gently in.</p></p>Changed our plans for the day as we so often do—from hiking Angel&rsquo;s Landing, which would look flat in the midday sun, to wandering for hours in Hidden Canyon. It was proper canyoning, scampering up walls smooth from erosion, leaping from rock to creek wall and back. Ducking tree branches. Going barefoot.</p></p>After the hustle and bustle of the shuttle, it felt blissfully quiet in the canyon. Back to the solitude we prefer.</p></p>Ate our sandwiches with our backs to the canyon wall. Considered going further but figured it was rubble and rough riparian forest from there out, so we turned tail (never quite reaching a point past old footprints) and headed back out of the canyon. Down the switchbacks to the paved trail and back out to the shuttle.</p></p>Went to the visitor centre to change electronics, and so I could mail postcards; these moments, hours in the visitors centre are our brief interactions with civilization. I&rsquo;m here with JJ and he&rsquo;s here with me, but it is kind of fun to be at the National Parks, even with all these millions, and to people-watch. Here—someone gave us their firewood. Someone else a can of beans. Everyone has advice and an opinion of which trail to hike and when, and what snakes to be worried about and what to do in a flash flood. Even in the crowd of the shuttle, we&rsquo;re surrounded by fellow hikers, travellers, adventure-seekers. If you have to have company, it&rsquo;s not bad company to keep.</p></p>It&rsquo;s different, anyway, from the wistfulness of the open highway. PK was telling me about the intimate magic of streetlights, that we pass them by without a glance, but how they light our way, kiss the pavement, serve as a meeting place for moths and bats. It&rsquo;s true, and it&rsquo;s everyday magic.</p></p>On the road—I kept noticing gas stations. Liminal spaces, gateways from one world to the next. Where all the weary people stop. On long, cross-country drives, you have to stop, and so maybe that&rsquo;s why I noticed.</p></p>Some of them are where the tourist buses stop, as evidenced by their tacky keychains and &ldquo;Native art&rdquo; with &ldquo;Made in China&rdquo; on the back. These I&rsquo;m eager enough to leave. But there are some—dusty ones. Only us and beat up pick-up trucks, farmers filling their tractors at the diesel pump. The attendant who calls me &lsquo;honey&rsquo; with tired eyes and faded denim. At these, I always turn back when we leave.</p></p>I like being on the road, and most of these places I&rsquo;ll never think of again. But there is a wandering. Of what their lives are, of what is.</p></p>&ldquo;In the desert (wrote Balzac, somewhere) there is all and there is nothing. God is there and man is not.&rdquo; — Edward Abbey, &lsquo;Desert Solitaire&rsquo;</p>
<h4>Day 24 - S24<br>
Zion National Park, UT</h4>
<p>Up before sunrise this morning so we&rsquo;d be on an early shuttle and beat the cross to the peak of Angel&rsquo;s landing.</p></p>Thankful it wasn&rsquo;t as cold as yesterday, but even more thankful for our hot drinks clutched in hand as we waited in the dark. At the trailhead, we stashed our travel mugs under a bush and started up the steep path, with it&rsquo;s 39 switchbacks. We made brief stops to delayer or switch turns with the backpack but mostly we hiked hard and long, up and up.</p></p>Until the scramble.</p></p>And then it turned joyful. He and I, we&rsquo;re light footed and sure, like the burn of lactic acid in our muscles and have no fear of heights. We barely used the chains, just hopped from rock to rock, pushing up and over. And then we were at the top. Whole valley, with the curves of the river and the peaks just coming into light as the sun still rose.</p></p>We stayed to take pictures, and admire, and soak in the vertigo defiance. I built an Inukshuk in a rock garden that others had contributed to over the years. We scared off a chipmunk. Smashed sandstone. Took more pictures.</p></p>But eventually (too soon) the wind was leaving me shivering, so we started down to warmer heights.</p></p>Took the shuttle back to the visitors centre to discover a queued line of hundreds; it was National Public Lands Day, and park entrance was free. Glad to have avoided the crowds, and desperate to continue to do so, we returned to camp to lazily make bannock and play guitar and read and edit photos in the midday sun.</p></p>&ldquo;We are nothing in a Shadeless Land … / Desert imposters with coyote ambitions.&rdquo; — Seth Muller, &lsquo;Death in Coyote Butte No. 1&rsquo;</p>
<h4>Day 25 - S25<br>
Zion National Park</h4>
<p>Up before the sun, and again to beat the crowds. We think yesterday was Day Lights Savings because this morning the sun rose much quicker—but we&rsquo;re basically living past the reaches of time. Only know the date because I write it here, and even then it seems to pass too quickly to be believable.</p></p>We ate our oatmeal in the car because it was too cold outside to sit on metal benches, we waited for the water to boil and made our hot chocolate. Clutching it gratefully as we made our way to the shuttle.</p></p>We were the only ones on our bus to get off at the last stop; by the time we reached the water&rsquo;s edge and the trailhead for the Narrows, there were a handful of others rolling up pant legs and repacking bags.</p></p>Trying to make ourselves feel brave (and warm), we walked into the river. It was a windy morning, and the sun had barely rose, let alone entered into the canyon. Cold felt colder.</p></p>The water was so icy it burned, at first, and then settled into a dull roaring ache. I was thinking of the small mountain of dry socks and sweaters back at camp. Of the hot chocolate we&rsquo;d just finished. Of our down sleeping bags in our snug tent. Of sunshine.</p></p>But cold doesn&rsquo;t care about distractions, and I felt cold anyway. I was struggling not to beg J 
to turn back, to voice how miserable I was becoming. Lucky, because just when I&rsquo;d had enough, we turned a bend and saw sunshine on the river ahead of us. The warmth was instantaneous. Felt my whole body brighten, unclench. As with every morning when we&rsquo;re up to watch the sunrise, I forget (and am startlingly reminded) of how dependent we are on the warmth, the powerful heat of the sun.</p></p>We&rsquo;d asked backpackers on their way out of the river about a side canyon we&rsquo;d wanted to explore, only to find we&rsquo;d passed it already. So we lay in the warmth of the sun until we could feel our feet again, and then we turned for the long soggy walk back to the trailhead.</p></p>When we&rsquo;d started out, the canyon walls were curved and towering, but dark, flat, eerie. It was only on the way back, with the sun&rsquo;s light finally reaching into the canyon, that the true glow of sandstone started to appear.</p></p>The Narrows are similar to Coyote Gulch. If I can, I still prefer the Gulch. But the Narrows are spectacular in a different way—they&rsquo;re taller, walls tighter together. The only hike I&rsquo;ve ever been on that was straight through a river. But it lacked the coziness of the Gulch, those glowing red walls that curved up towards the sky so elegantly. Lacked the echo, the humming burble; this was ceaseless chortle that lapped over conversation, so insistent. And certainly it lacked the solitude of the Gulch. We were part of maybe a dozen when we headed out, but that was the limit of the cold. We passed more than a thousand on the hike from the Narrows&rsquo; depths to the trailhead, all vying for the same paths through the rapids, walking sticks clacking on stone.</p></p>It&rsquo;s the Park&rsquo;s most popular hike, and it&rsquo;s world renowned. Can&rsquo;t blame it for being busy, and I&rsquo;m glad to have hiked it while we were here. But I&rsquo;m even more thankful to think we&rsquo;re privy to one of Utah&rsquo;s most beautiful, secret places, and I like to think that someday I&rsquo;ll return to the Gulch.</p></p>As night falls—</p></p>Jon&rsquo;s here, strumming and writing lyrics to his stagecoach robber lullaby. The campground is starting to fill with smoke as fires smoulder in their beginnings. The kids down the way are climbing a boulder and giggling to themselves—don&rsquo;t we all like to feel tall sometimes? And the Watchman glowed red at sunset but he&rsquo;s dark and silent now. Just one more day ended and he&rsquo;s done his duty.</p><p>This is our last night here, and second last before Yosemite.</p><p>The sky burned quick and hot this afternoon; it&rsquo;s not early fall yet, we decided, but late summer. Another hiker told us she was sad to have left Colorado, all the aspens are turning and the hills are alive with colour. The cottonwoods here are still hanging heavy and green. We still have time.</p><p>The sky&rsquo;s getting dark now, quiet. Only fires crackling around us, and the soft voices of hikers tired from today&rsquo;s (and yesterday&rsquo;s) trails.</p><p>Laughter and sighs and crickets.  And from the Watchman, once everything else has faded and turned to sleep, a contented hum.</p>
<h4>Day 27 - S27<br>
Mammoth Lakes SP, CA to Yosemite National Park, CA</h4>
<p>Last night we stayed in Mammoth Lakes, a tiny chateau town with streets hidden under pine trees, the welcome sign quoting John Muir, &ldquo;The mountains are calling…&rdquo; It was the last place before Yosemite with a grocery store, hence our stay. But it was an all too-fitting place, and I was glad of our small campground on its mountain pass, for the lake that held the morning sun&rsquo;s reflection, and the aspens that had waited for us to turn. We bought our cheese, meat, bread. Had our first shower in a week, and it&rsquo;ll be another week before our next. Stayed up later than we planned running laundry and the dryer, packing bags and sorting food.</p><p>We were back on the road first thing, through the mountain pass. Hitched to the trailhead, and started the long climb up. We climber 2500ft in elevation in 5 or so miles. Sweat dripping, calves complaining, blisters forming.</p><p>I counted paces instead of switchbacks, and passed my walking stick from hand to hand, feeling my heart thick under my collarbone. Part of me wondering if we aren&rsquo;t actually masochists—why do we all this, anyhow?</p><p>But it was the moments of—the desperately tall pines, after weeks in the desert, with their just-as-otherwordly neon green moss. The light filtering amongst them. The song of the wind passing through pine needles. The word &lsquo;love&rsquo; spelled out in pinecones beside the trail, and Jonathon, chuckle-sighing, pointing, &ldquo;<u>Humans</u>.&rdquo; Or, for that matter, the graffiti in the trailhead porta-potty: &lsquo;You are completely free. Quit your job and grow your hair out.&rsquo;</p><p>It was the sight of El Capitán, stoic, hugely tall, and pale as a marble cathedral. Its quiet beauty bringing tears to my eyes. The swallows as they whirled and dipped around me, the slick whizz of their wingbeats. And finally, setting up camp at the rim of the mountain range. Making dinner in tune with the sunset—reds and oranges filling the sky and giving way to patient blue.</p><p>Venus appearing as we lit a fire, which, in turn, burnt low as constellations began to fill the sky.</p><p>Seeing other campers&rsquo; fires on the next point over, waving cheerfully and returning to our quiet camp. That&rsquo;s why we do it.</p>
<h4>Day 28 - S28<br>
Yosemite National Park, CA</h4>
<p>John Muir fell in love with this place. The boy would pack sourdough loaves and go tramping through Tuolumne Meadows, the flats, climb the mountains themselves. He waxed poetic about the ragtag shrubs dotting the hills, the aching pines with their sunshine boughs and moss-heavy bark, the creeks on their jostling burbling route out of the heights.</p><p>Now that we&rsquo;re here, it&rsquo;s so easy to love it also. I always knew I was a forest person—it&rsquo;s my home, it&rsquo;s in my bones.</p><p>So while the desert was weird and fascinating and beautiful, this place makes me want to shout and run and lie down in the sun and climb and pray and breathe deep and cry. Even the dust smells right.</p> <h4>Day 29 - S29<br>
Yosemite National Park, CA</h4>
Today was a <u>day</u>. Gluts aching, feet tingling, heels rubbed raw. Only 3pm and I&rsquo;m ready for dinner and bed.</p><p>We packed up camp and rolled out of the woods around 4:15am, made quick time on the empty path to Glacier Pt. Got there way before the sun, and curled up in our layers at the foot of the amphitheatre steps in expectation. Nearly but couldn&rsquo;t quite doze off, without the sun these mornings are always too cold.</p><p>Sun came and reflected pink off the clouds, illuminating Half Dome and the valley below. We munched snacks and kept hiking. Climbed down to a creek and up to a peak, and then repeated. Drank water and refilled our bottles by a waterfall. Our steps got heavier as the day pressed on, and it wasn&rsquo;t just with the weight of our packs—the night and early morning lying thick on our shoulders.</p><p>We&rsquo;re at the backpacker&rsquo;s Half Dome base camp now—triangles and squares marked out by cut pines. Each of us with a patch under the towering pines, and bear boxes to share.</p><p>Half Dome lies on the horizon behind our tent. Rather—it is the horizon. There won&rsquo;t be any sunset chasing tonight, we&rsquo;re getting an early sleep so that the wind won&rsquo;t catch us on the quick ride up. Gonna be cold up there, before the sun, so we&rsquo;re trying to time it right.</p><p>This morning, as we sat waiting for the sun at Glacier Pt., we could see headlamps bobbing at Half Dom&rsquo;s peak. In a couple hours, that will be our light shining out across the valley.</p><p>We saw more hikers today as we passed through the valley and by a couple trailheads, but still it&rsquo;s not nearly as busy as I expected. More—I feel like we&rsquo;re seeing this place in it&rsquo;s pine-heady wilderness, the place where a lonely Scottish shepherd found himself. Sit still long enough and you&rsquo;d think the pines are sigh-singing just for you. It&rsquo;s almost more comforting to think that their song has been humming through this valley for centuries now, and we aren&rsquo;t the only recipeants of its dedication.</p><p>Still. There&rsquo;s that pine-in-sunshine smell, and nothing smells as comforting as that.</p>
<h4>Day 30 - S30<br>
Yosemite National Park, CA</h4>
<p>&ldquo;And they say youth is wasted on the young,&rdquo; an older man said to his partner, shaking his head at our tall heavy packs and thick boots biting the dust—weary steps but a warm hello.</p><p>Switchbacks ache any way or time you take them, and the ones up to Half Dome (not even the sub-Dome, just the ones to the trailhead) feel harder and rougher than most. Witht he pack they felt only hard and rough, and frankly we had a right to the compliment. Even more so granted that it was our second time up.</p><p>We got up at 1:30am, made oatmeal and rolled out onto the trail. We weren&rsquo;t exactly sure how long it&rsquo;d take—only 3.5m but 2700ft, and in the dark we couldn&rsquo;t be sure—and we didn&rsquo;t want to miss it.</p><p>Walked quick since the bag just held our warm layers and water; even with the rocks the trail seemed to fly by. It&rsquo;s easier to chat in the cold night air, breath comes easier and staying awake is necessary.</p><p>So we overshot by nearly 2h—got to the base of the sub-Dome just after 5am.</p><p>We layered up and curled behind a ledge of rock, out of the wind, and fell asleep. Almost didn&rsquo;t want to close our eyes with the falling stars overhead, but weariness won. Managed to doze and woke to the alarm 45m later, chills working their way deep within my body.</p><p>Usually when I&rsquo;m cold, I curl tighter, trying to conserve what little I&rsquo;ve got left. But we had a steep climb up the cables ahead of us, and we needed to be warm. J put on summer dance beats and we jumped and shook and danced. Next time I&rsquo;m at a club, the drop of the bass will send me back to the edge of the sub-Dome of Yosemite, 6am as the stars twinkled and faded above. Hearts pumping quick, we started on the cables. Half Dome, as it turns out, it about as steep as it looks. The cables were almost more like a ladder than anything, and it was mostly an arm workout, as we pulled ourselves up the smooth granite.</p><p>The wind was biting and whirling and tugging, but we&rsquo;d dressed for the occasion and the climb warmed us. The mountain range in the distance turned pink and yellow. In a moment, maybe more, the sun broke above the horizon and the day began.</p><p>Half Dome is bigger than I thought, and rougher than it looks. Boulders and crevices and cairns, trees and shrubs. All on what felt like the roof of the valley. We explored, and finally climbed down.</p><p>On the way back to the base camp, we passed 226 climbers headed up—a far cry from the 2 others who&rsquo;d started the morning with us. If you want to enjoy famous places and glorious sights unobstructed, the key, apparently, is to be a sunriser.</p><p>Got back to camp, and J promptly slept til noon. I lazed in a sunbeam. After lunch we decided it&rsquo;d be a silly thing not to keep moving, so we packed up and headed for John Muir camp, just off the Half Dome trail. And back up we went.</p><p>From here, the wind is roaring through the pines. Half Dome stands, unflinching in the distance, past the edge of our camp and it seems incredulous to think that we climbed her this morning.</p><p>Of course, the balls of my feet, my calves, the muscles along my hips all agree that we did, and I&rsquo;ll sleep well tonight.</p>
<h4>Day 31 - O1<br>
Yosemite National Park, CA</h4>
<p>Seems like we just don&rsquo;t do easy out here.</p><p>Started the day hiking 2700ft in 3.5m or so—straight up the switchbacks of Cloud&rsquo;s Rest. We&rsquo;d gotten 13h of sleep or more since our exhausting Half Dome day previous, and I woke feeling rejuvenated—until we hit the trail. Shiit I gotta do my stretches.</p><p>The hike up was about the hardest thing we&rsquo;ve done yet, my God I&rsquo;ve never been so thankful to see a group of tourists laughing and standing and jostling for their turn at the scenic overlook.</p><p>We sat as much out of the gust of the wind as possible (but there was no escaping) and had our lunch. You sit long enough, boots off, soaking in the sun&rsquo;s warmth when it appears, and you can forget all kids of pain. Including, of course, what it takes to hike switchback after switchback with (half of) camp on your back.</p><p>And the view! Half Dome, rising out of a blue-morning hazy valley. The other domes and valley sides leaning on all sides. That sky stretching and soaring, and the ravens delighting in thermals all about. Not a bad place to have lunch.</p><p>We conferred with all the other hikers on top about the weather forecast—we&rsquo;d passed two hikers that morning who warned of coming snow. No one seems really sure—some promising it&rsquo;d never hit us, others that it&rsquo;d be sleet if anything, and others still that Tioga Pass weight be closed, to get out of the backcountry by 10am.</p><p>We walked down out of Cloud&rsquo;s Rest with a young woman and her son, locals, she&rsquo;s hiked all through Yosemite. She gave guidance and reassurance and a little advice, and in the end we revised our plan for the last few miles of the trip.</p><p>With food rations running low, exhaustion running high, and a storm system (maybe) on the horizon, we decided to hike out to the Sunrise Lakes, spend one last night in the backcountry, watch the sun rise, and hike out in the morning. It was a compromise: we wanted to do more than just hike down to Tenaya and kill time until we felt we could reasonably hike out, and by the time we were hiking down from Cloud&rsquo;s Rest, we knew we were too tired to hit Cathedral Peaks. But I think we underestimated how tired we really were. The gentle downward slopes were fine, but—God. When the path got rocky and rough, or with steep uphill steps, I could barely think. Just felt as the muscles behind my knees complained, my hips rubbed under ym waist-straps, my thighs, my ankles, my back.</p><p>We finally reached the fork and saw that the Sunrise Lakes were 2.5m away, and our hearts sank. We&rsquo;re getting pretty quick with the mental m-km conversion, and neither of us felt like hiking another 4km.</p><p>Thankful hikers coming from that direction assured us that that was the distance to the camp at the end of the trail; the Lakes were maybe a mile, mile-and-a-half.</p><p>Even still, we got here aching. Dropped bags, changed into camp shoes, and started setting up camp like second nature. We&rsquo;ve each got our tasks, we run in clockwork. Even when we&rsquo;re exhausted.</p><p>Ate double dinner since our extra night had evaporated during the day. Made tea and watched the sun sink below the far-away line of the valley, slowly filling the hazy view that Sunday sorbet pink and gold.</p><p>As the sun faded, the cold we&rsquo;d been edging all day came slinking back. October has arrived and all the signs are showing—the shrubs turning yellow or red, losing leaves. The morning chill and layers. Evening clutching a warm mug with all its steam. The hint or promise of snow.</p><p>So, per Jonathon&rsquo;s request, we lit a fire down by the lake. Symmetry of our time in Yose, that we&rsquo;d have a fire on our first and last nights, journalling side by side in the dancing glow.</p><p>We&rsquo;ve been out here 5 days, and we&rsquo;ve only missed 2 sunrises and sunsets. Time has passed quickly, blearily. Hiking blurs the days and the morning and nights are shelter skelter. It&rsquo;s all peak-creek-pine rush, and always the light.</p> <h4>Day 33 - O3<br>
Fresno, CA to Big Sur, CA</h4>
<p>The last morning we spent in Yosemite, it froze. We awoke before the sunrise (it seemed only fitting for the lake we were at) and hat made it feel all the colder. Our water bottles were full of ice, the tent covered in forest. We could see our breath, feet stomping, hands shoved in pockets. The mist was swirling over the surface of the lake, and the sun looked a long ways off.</p><p>We made tea, to stave off the chill, and waited. Soon enough the peaks of trees beside and behind us were showing the light of the sun, and then it hit us. Instant warmth.</p><p>Even still, we made oatmeal with the last of our gorp (melting chocolate, salty raisins) and sat in the tent, cold toes in sleeping bags, and with the door wide open, letting the sunlight in. I&rsquo;ve had good mornings, and scenic views, felt cosy and comfortable—but there&rsquo;s not better way to welcome the dawn than that.</p><p>We took our time packing. No rush, and nothing pulling us away from that title paradise. Ate the very last of our food on the walk down, switchbacks almost as rough as the way up.</p><p>The sudden blue of Tenaya Lake was a very welcome sight, and the dusty red of our car just as sweet.</p><p>Unpacked our gear and rolled out to get gas, music filling the car as we sang and hummed our way out of the valley. Drove from Yosemite to Fresno—the largest city between us and the coast, and where we were hoping to find camp, showers, and a cheap burger joint.</p><p>The RV camp we found (only tent site left in Fresno) was in a dust bowl of chainlink houses and cheap liquor convenience stores. All-way stops and the freeway round the corner. The tent site was in between the pool, porta-potty, and dumpsters, with a fluorescent light that never turned off.</p><p>The only shower was an outside rinse by the pool, so I scrubbed Yosemite dust off my legs and wrists and neck in a trellis-fence cubicle with a door that didn&rsquo;t latch. All of New Horizons RV might&rsquo;ve seen me naked but at least I was clean.</p><p>Headed into the glow of downtown Fresno—all highway and unused, unloved rest-stops to too-quickly eat our burger-fry-shakes at the red and white plastic diner full of tired-eyed ghosts.</p><p>Fucking Fresno.</p><p>But the moon was barely a sliver in the pale pink-blue when we left, Venus bright in the sky and palm trees silhouetted. Not a bad sight, for all that.</p><p>Got back to the tent to watch Avatar and try to digest what was almost certainly more calories than we&rsquo;d had in a week. Listened to the highway and tried to block out the light and the dogs barking, and checked tumblr and insta after a week in the mountains and fidgeted. Night came and we slept and woke and slept again.</p><p>Were up before the sun, though no alarm this time, just the fitfulness of night, and watched in turn everything a soft pink and yellow-orange. It rises as it always does, even in Fresno.</p><p>Made bannock with PB&J like we&rsquo;d been dreaming of in the High Sierras. Drank hot chocolate and got groceries and did our laundry. Checked our reservation for the coast and got ready to roll out yet again.</p><p>Drove through pale yellow fields of dry grass stalk, rolling hills the only thing between us and the ocean. And then suddenly, we were up in the hills in wine country—vineyard after vineyard, and offerings of tastings at every driveway.</p><p>Hit the tops of the hills and the horizon was a deep hay endless blue. Put on the Coat playlist and entered down singing California.</p><p>Highway 1 is a twisty thing, cutting round the edge of the mountain coast. Turquoise turning to slate as the sun faded on the left, and National Forest to the right, all blocked off and closed due to the wildfires lighting the area.</p><p>We turned off at Limekiln, still a stretch from Big Sur (on fire) and a relocation from our original park (closed due to the fire). It was what they had and it was on the coast.</p><p>And as it turned out, it was beautiful. Went for a quick 0.5m hike through the Redwoods to see the original lime kilns, huge decrepit metal and brick where they smelted (we presume) the lime into a usable material. All graffitied now.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a gentle creek running behind our campsite, and the smell of pine in the air. It feels like fall—finally, almost, after the heat of the desert, and as we were sipping our hot chocolates and looking over the forest, we realized (or at least vocalized) that there&rsquo;s something waiting for us back in Ontario that we&rsquo;ll be glad to see.</p>
<h4>Day 34 - O4<br>
Limekiln State Park, CA</h4>
<p>The mornings are a lot colder now, and we keep waking before the sun reaches us. As long as we&rsquo;ve got hot chocolate and bannock, we&rsquo;re alright.</p><p>All of our plans for the coast had dissipated in the heat of the wildfire, so our new plan was just—drive down the 1 and see what there was to see.</p><p>And indeed, the coast called to us. We stopped to hike the McWay Waterfall trail at Julia Pfieffer and see the turquoise lagoon with the white surf cresting. Took pictures at a scenic lookout and stopped at the far edge of Big Sur to make PB & banana sandwiches on the high coast cliff, naval base lighthouse on a rocky outcropping beneath us.</p><p>And stopped at a library, an artist&rsquo;s home and memorial, with its record collected and bookstore and garden concert stage. An obscure nook, the exact sort of place you&rsquo;d hope would find you, though sometimes you have to go looking to find. Read through their poetry and drank their coffee and signed the guestbook wistfully.</p><p>Then there was the snooty gallery, with its crystal statues and expensive paintings. We drummed out sunshine singing on the carved wooden music boxes, and left.</p><p>The last of our stops before our returns the hermitage of the New Camaldoli monks. We tasted their honey and cakes and holy granola, listened to the rhythm of their prayers, hands rinsed in holy water and myrrh. Softly touched carved and moulded crosses and drove gently on the twisting mountain pass down from its peak.</p><p>A far cry from the wild solitude of Yosemite, and a further cry from the desperation of Fresno. If to for the wildfire, I don&rsquo;t know that we would&rsquo;ve had a day on this trip dedicated to simple art galleries and bookstores and prayerful study. But we did.</p><p>While most of this adventure has been spent—deliberately or not—avoiding other people, today was a gentle reflection on what culture <u>can</u> be. I read poetry today, touched prayer beads and saints&rsquo; protective amulets. Passed cafés and restaurants and spas, and many other adventures smiling big joyful as the camera clicked. Felt gladdened by art and possibility. <u>Humans</u>.

Dear Ontario,<br>
Who will have changed more when we meet again?</p><p>Dear Michigan,<br>
They say nothing knows abandonment like a highway, not even God, but I felt more aching here than I do when I pray.</p><p>Dear Indiana,<br>
I didn&rsquo;t notice you passing &rsquo;til you were already gone. I don&rsquo;t know how to apologize for that.</p><p>Dear Illinois,<br>
Those bridges, those towering spires. Dignity and space in a city on the edge.</p><p>Dear Missouri,<br>
Billboards screaming sex clubs & shooting ranges, in fields of endless corn. Y&rsquo;all bored or what?</p><p>Dear Kansas,<br>
Wide and wild and empty. Must be hard being that lonely.</p><p>Dear Colorado,<br>
You gave me dry lips and boulders, sand and silence and Sherpa grapes. Only asked for part of my heart in return.</p><p>Dear Utah,<br>
I never felt so found, getting lost in you.</p><p>Dear Arizona,<br>
We cut your corner and drove off into the desert, singing switchbacks in red and orange.</p><p>Dear Nevada,<br>
Like rivers to the ocean, your highways and cars are all bound for Vegas. We didn&rsquo;t stop.</p><p>Dear California,<br>
The mountain mornings to know what I&rsquo;m capable of, and the coast to recover. You gave me blue and red and you made me cry.</p><p>Dear Nevada,<br>
Like rivers to the ocean, your highways and cars are all bound for Vegas. We still didn&rsquo;t stop.</p><p>Dear Arizona,<br>
It was deeper than I expected.</p><p>Dear Colorado,<br>
You took us higher and colder than we&rsquo;d dared ask. Thanks for the warning.</p><p>Dear Wyoming,<br>
I counted exit signs to break the monotony of hayfields.</p><p>Dear Nebraska,<br>
At least you had trees.</p><p>Dear Iowa,<br>
That soaked screaming pavement, the rearview vermillion, the clouds above us like waves.</p><p>Dear Illinois,<br>
You&rsquo;re building highways so we had to stay slow. I remain resentful.</p><p>Dear Indiana,<br>
2am breakfast, you passed in a dream of hip-hop and jazz.</p><p>Dear Michigan,<br>
If you wanted us to stay, you could have asked.</p><p>Dear Ontario,<br>
That familiar comfort, in forest and highway rest-stop. Our families voices echoing. Relief. Home.</p>
<h4>Day 35 - O5<br>
Limekiln ST, CA to Joshua Tree National Park, CA
<p>We thought it was maybe a 4h drive, so we packed up early but leisurely, and lingered at scenic stops along the coast. And then drove for 8h.</p><p>It was the first drove heading back east (cue celebratory granola) so we&rsquo;re back in the desert now. Arrived at Joshua Tree at 5pm or so, and the hikes we&rsquo;d planned—to see a cactus garden, or hike up to a vantage panorama of the desert—well. After a day driving through the desert, any desire to hike out to see more of it sort of dissipates.</p><p>So we went downtown to watch a wild west film instead. We thought we recognized parts of Utah where it was shot, which was cool. The dashing hero dies in an explosion of dynamite, which was not. But when in the West, in the desert, in decrepit towns with roads and trails called Horsethief Pass—it felt like the best thing to do.</p>
<h4>Day 37 - O7<br>
Grand Canyon NP, AZ to Page, AZ</h4>
<p>I read a poem in the Zion NP visitor centre bookshop about the Grand Canyon. The author&rsquo;s horrified disapproval at a woman he overhead, leaving, saying, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I just thought it&rsquo;d be deeper.&rsquo;</p><p>We got in after dark, 9pm and hadn&rsquo;t had dinner. The temperature had dropped while we&rsquo;d been driving so we pulled up in shorts & tanks to a 1ºC night. And found that the reservations I&rsquo;d made for our stay were at the South Rim campground—a 5h drive away.</p><p>Definite regret. But what could we do? We made a quick dinner in the parking lot, set up our tent in the dark and fell asleep in a site set aside for backpackers. Woke up early to watch the sun light fill the canyon valley.</p><p>Waked quick to the sunrise at the edge of the rim. My heart just about broke when I overheard one woman murmur to her companion, &lsquo;It gets better, right?&rsquo; Seth Muller would&rsquo;ve pushed her over the edge. I just turned away.</p><p>If anything, the canyon was deeper than I&rsquo;d expected, and wider. All twisting side canyons and blue gray mist from the North side, the rock edging redder as the sun climbed.</p><p>We drove to the highest point, Pt. Imperial, and then to the Cape Royal viewpoint, through glowing aspens that shook nervously in the morning breeze.</p><p>Came to a stop at a turnout for Greenland Lake—a dried puddle turned meadow surrounded by the same aspens and pines. We were sheltered from the wind, and the sun beat down soft and yellow. It wasn&rsquo;t a pretty place, really—not awe-inspiring or majestic. But it was gentle, quiet. We ate dried fruit and flowed in the grass and laughed at the oddness of loving so simple a place. But we did.</p><p>Drove half a minute out of the park before stopping to eat lunch in the sunshine—maybe the only time we haven&rsquo;t crushed out sandwiches on the road. Climbed a fire lookout tower brave like we were trespassing but the lookout just shook the ladder laughing and welcomed us up, pointing out scars from fires long ago, and rubbing sleep from his eyes.</p><p>Read our way through the desert, walking the Colorado bridge and touching handmade jewellery at a roadside stop.</p><p>Made it to Horseshoe Bend just a moment before sunset, enough time to clamber down the cliff to the amazed and horrified delight of other tourists. Sat comfy and journaled on the edge below them—let them wonder and snap photos of their own while we soaked in setting sun light.</p><p>Like how J walked tightrope on the handrails along popular Grand Canyon vistas, we bend camp culture to fit us. Trust ourselves and our bodies and each other, so nothing is unreachable. Safety isn&rsquo;t manufactured, it&rsquo;s earned. We play rough but we&rsquo;re careful, and the payoff is always worth it.</p>
<h4>Day 40 - O10<br>
Masonville, CO to Kalamazoo, MI</h4>
The road back east has detoured enough. We&rsquo;re heading home—unshowered and tired, exactly as you should be after a month and a half away.</p><p>We drove from Page, AZ with its grand canyons (lowercase) and oil change popcorn, headed to the mountains. We didn&rsquo;t make it—puling off highway in the late dark to make dinner in a National Forest turn-off, and set up our tent in the already near-negatives.</p><p>Unzipped the tent in the morning to find a ranch next door, rooster crowing and barn rising out of the mist. Made hot choco and sat in the car with cold fingers, cold toes, waiting for the iced windshield to melt. Didn&rsquo;t bring an ice scraper cause we were heading into the desert, so were were sheepish Canadians in our element, but unprepared.</p><p>Got to Rocky Mountain NP early enough, but it would&rsquo;ve bee too late a night, and anyway it was still too late for us to grab a campsite. Drove hopeful along the cross-park highway, or as quick as stuck-behind-an-RV-on-switchbacks-traffic would let us, but the campgrounds were full and the trails busy.</p><p>Hiked to a couple glacier lakes, marching through pine paved paths cause we had somewhere to be—debating the merits of tethering wild-spaces to parking lots, trying not to be hypocritical, and trying to imagine what Edward Abbey and John Muir would&rsquo;ve said.</p><p>Cleared two day trips in a couple hours, didn&rsquo;t even change from my camp shoes (everything feels easy post-Yose) and shuttled back to out to reclaim the mountain range for sunset.</p><p>The clouds turned yellow then orange then pink, peaks glittering with melting snow and rising our of falling clouds.</p><p>Drive away from Arizona as canyons and mesas turned into scrubland and back into rolling aspen hills, we&rsquo;d said goodbye to the desert. Here, blinking sun spots from our eyes as the light faded from the alpine tundra, from the valley with its strict straight pines, from the blue-grey mountain pass, we said farewell to the mountains as well.</p><p>Hurried back to the car&rsquo;s shelter from the wind and our PB&J dinner, cruised down off the summit on an empty tank. The night started settling in and we started looking for a piece of National Forest to settle into.</p><p>Found a National Wilderness Area, and figuring they were about the same thing, set up camp under an apple orchard. Packed up in the morning in record time, thinking of the long interstate day ahead of us—and were startled by the US Ranger walking out of the deserted (we&rsquo;d thought) ranch house towards us.</p><p>Turns out camping in a National Wilderness Area is a federal offence, fine and mandatory court appearance. Shit.</p><p>But we were cutesy enough—twins tripping to National Parks with their annotated state map, out-of-country and a little lost—that he wrote us both a warning and told us to be good. We shook his hand (all of us cold) and drove off thankful, wondering where we&rsquo;d go to make our hot chocolate.</p><p>Hit the interstate, gonna be on the I-80 for some time ow, and blasted Good Day. Mistakes happen, but some rangers are understanding, and now we know the difference between Forests and Wilderness Areas. If we ever come back to Fort Collins County, we&rsquo;re gonna toe the line.</p> <h4>Day 41 - O11<br>
Kalamazoo, MI to Home</h4>
<p>We&rsquo;d been planning on having one late night on the hustle back to ON, just for the story and the midnight Denny&rsquo;s, and the thrill of 1am on the interstate, just us and the transport trucks. But we hadn&rsquo;t planned on that being last night. Left Colorado feeling light, and as we turned onto the I-80, the one that would take us back to the border, J said, &ldquo;Feel like I could do this all day.&rdquo; And then we did.</p><p>Refilled the tank, then again, and again, and kept blasting pop tunes and sing-singing along as the highway grew busy, light high in the sky, and then emptied as the sun set in Iowa, a vibrant pink in our rearview mirror.</p><p>Rain came hard and drizzled, and then left altogether as we high a system, outlived it, hit another and outran it.</p><p>Soon enough it was midnight, then 1, then 2 and the highway was empty. We went for Denny&rsquo;s—too much breakfast but it was all good and then we left both light and heavier at the same time—and then it was 3.</p><p>Ran the line and the time jumped ahead an hour and it was 4 but we weren&rsquo;t tired yet—</p><p>Only figured we should sleep while it was dark still, so we pulled into a rest stop and brushed our teeth in the deserted bathrooms, passing other cars in the lot with their sleeping cargo, and it was quarter to 5 and we were exhausted. Pulled hats over our eyes to block the street lights cracked the window and shimmied into our bags, jostling legs and elbows and pillows int eh awkward curve of the car&rsquo;s front seats.</p><p>Slept uneasy or not, I don&rsquo;t really remember. Woke to an accidental setting-off the car alarm, and to the softer, quieter rise of the sun, but fell back asleep early. No interstate dreaming.</p><p>Now the sun is halfway risen and the highway beside us is loud busy full. We&rsquo;re only a couple hours from the border, and a couple more from home. We&rsquo;ll be able to stop to visit the grandparents, and be home for dinner. Real beds. Hot shower. Family.</p><p>And so ends the trip. Not with a bang, nor a whimper. Just a contented sigh that we did it, we made it, and all of these together.</p><p>The sun&rsquo;s rising higher now. Most of the leaves have fallen from the trees around us, and we&rsquo;re still waiting on the water to boil for our last American hot chocolate. Eating up apple pie before the border, and in the sunshine glowing gold, with all our knits, this feels like the perfect autumn.</p><p>Glad the family waited for us cause I&rsquo;m going home thankful and it&rsquo;ll be nice to share. They&rsquo;re going to ask what it was like and to tell them stories. That&rsquo;s never easy but now we&rsquo;ve got so many and they&rsquo;re all good.</p><p>Try to tell them what it&rsquo;s like laughing til you cry at imagine-ifs and funny voices and exhaustion and grasshoppers. What it&rsquo;s like to watch sunset after sunset, sunrise after sunrise. How they&rsquo;re never the same, except the sense of wonder. What it&rsquo;s like to pack up camp at midnight, at 4am, at dawn, to work like sped-up clockwork and never doubt. What it&rsquo;s like to make the desert your playground, to hear the roaring swell of the coast, to march in reverent awe of pine and granite. Or what it&rsquo;s like to be bone tired and to keep hiking anyway, to hoist the pack and tie your shoes and listen to the call of the trail.</p><p>We did good, he and I—saw what we wanted. They&rsquo;re going to ask if we got along the whole time, and that answer will be easier than any other. We&rsquo;re partners. Trusting has never felt easier.</p>
<h4>Day 42 - O12<br>
Home (the day after)</h4>
<p>As soon as we crossed the border we felt better. Safer. Comforted. Something about the air the trees the feeling—</p>
<p>And we pulled into the drive with the kitchen all lit cause mama had waited so we could have dinner together, our stars again, and the familiar gravel crunch.</p><p>We&rsquo;d stopped to visit Grandma and Grandpa, called Dan on his way home from work, and Dad on his way to a board meeting. The puppy was all frantic with gladness, running circles and circles.</p><p>Took the ATV out this morning to se the ol&rsquo; familiar sights and the autumn colours have never looked so beautiful. Redder and more charming than the aspen hills of Colorado, and our forests are lovelier than any of Yosemite.</p><p>Haven&rsquo;t turned my phone back on yet. Read a letter from Sharifa and clutched it to my chest like they do in old films, heart spilling with glad-fullness. But I&rsquo;ll do my phone tomorrow. Checked marks but haven&rsquo;t started the papers yet. Cleared my inbox of junk and skimmed the rest, but the real return can happen tomorrow. I&rsquo;ll unpack, sort, organize, settle.</p><p>For now—the sun is warm, the air smells right. I&rsquo;m home.</p></article>
