<h4>Day 1 - S1<br>
Home to Quincy, MI</h4>
<p>Took us longer to pack than expected but shorter to reach the border. Customs took our tomatoes. We got lost in Detroit&em;that cracked pavement city with its broken-glass grin. Took the heritage route instead of the interstate, a happy mistake as the air turned gold and the clouds heavy pink&em;you wanna be in quiet corners and antique capitals.</p>
<p>Set up camp quick. Re-packed the car and it feels more month-and-a-bit manageable. Got coffee and donuts (free) at a small grocery store out of town so tomorrow will be an easy start.</p>
<p>We're figuring it out. Taking turns driving and paying for gas. Playing music and harmonizing and tomorrow he&rsquo;ll get the guitar out. Started <i>Dharma Bums</i>&em;we&rsquo;ll see how many books we get through. Got a phone and snapchatted pics to the fam. Gonna settle further into the swing of this tomorrow. Good first day! We forgot to pack towels.</p>

<h4>Day 2 - S2<br>
Quincy, MI to Lawrence, KS</h4>
<p>Crossed four states today. Jonathon played guitar all the way through Illinois, passed ina foot-tapping wink of cornfields and blue sky. Detoured into St. Louis by accident but the bridge was distracting and seeing the heritage of downtown made it worth it. Kansas City was a highlight&em;the interstate rode up over buildings and bustle, we were on level with sky as the city swept over us.</p>
<p>But it was one or two highways all day. Maps and music and blue blue. We&rsquo;re fitting and flowing from one action to the next, and we barely gotta mention, we&rsquo;re clockwork. Which is great and good, but it doesn&rsquo;t leave much space for starting emotional conversations.</p>
<p>Luke&rsquo;s in the hospital recovering from an OD attempt. We hope recovering. Haven&rsquo;t really heard. We&rsquo;re both compartmentalizing our emotional response, and Jon&rsquo;s conscious of his reach&em;I have to remember that my brothers are two very different people, who react to things differently. And maybe we&rsquo;ll get to having those conversations. Started this morning with banana bread and mochaccinos. Ended it with lemon-pepper cheesy couscous with veggie stir fry.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t sleep much/well last night because I kept dreaming that I was speeding down the interstate, about to crash into cars ahead. Hoping that after day two I won&rsquo;t be dreaming of it any more.</p>
The road is still running quick and easy. PK is thinking about me and smiling, his heart on his face. I wanna be loved by him, even though I don&rsquo;t think I really want to be touched by anyone these days. If not him, then who? That weekend was an eye-opener. I&rsquo;m not good, got trauma, got healing to do. Can&rsquo;t keep repressing to please others because&em;it doesn’t please others. Hurts them, makes hem feel used maybe. So sort your pain and poison, and regroup. And in the meantime, believe that a boy angel is glowing for you.</p>
<p>The cicadas were screaming when we came in, but they&rsquo;ve quieted now. Might be how we wake. Hoping to leave early because we didn&rsquo;t have change so we did&rsquo;t self-pay&em;if we&rsquo;re up and out with the sunrise, maybe that&rsquo;s okay. Dharma Bums.</p>

<h4>Day 9 - S9<br>
Boulder, CO</h4>
<p>Arrived in town late last night. Got a warm bed at Michael&rsquo;s, a friend of JJ&rsquo;s from last time he was here. Had a shower in the morning, leaving sand all over the shower floor (my god I looked thin and sunburnt in the bathroom mirror). Ate pancakes. Ran errands. Phone fixed, car fixed, picked out a winter sleeping bag&em;lunch from a food truck and dinner at a Nepalese restaurant. Meeting Michael&rsquo;s friends and falling for Boulder one Subaru and sideways glance at the Flatirons at a time.</p>
<p>And then the garden concert&em;Michael&rsquo;s old friend back in town playing a goodbye gig in the garden of friends moving away. Voice like heaven, loop pedal tapping. All of us gathered in blankets and borrowed sweaters under stars and string lights. The man sang, we listened. All breathless and laughing and soft. Intimate. Make all concerts that kind of hushed.</p>
<h4>Day 13 - S13<br>
Elephant canyon, UT to Big Spring, UT</h4>
All this catch-up&em;still in Boulder. Breakfast in Nederland, riding the carousel of happiness, &ldquo;so shines a good deed in a weary world.&rdquo; Silly (or not) that such simple carved wood should make us each so emotional. Hand-spun doughnuts in their cinnamon sugar dusting. The long canyon road back.</p>
<p>Visiting Jon&rsquo;s family friends, biking for ice cream with him on the longboard in tow. Whirling round corners, catching the pedestrian approval of all those Boulder sports fanatics. Ice cream never tasted so sweet. All the hover boarding, the shower, the warm duvet.</p>
<p>Itzcuauhtli&rsquo;s big beaming (braces-full) smile when I told him meeting him was my wonder.</p>
<p>And then being back on the road again. Boulder was kind and soft and&em;quick, but to be interstate cruising, singular laughing again. Took a detour, the best detour. Up through Leadville (&ldquo;Great Living at 10,200’&rdquo;) and across the continental divide. Missed the photo op but we had places to go, those too-quick corners and golden trees. Good music blasting. Got snacks and a destination, isn&rsquo;t that everything?</p>
<p>Missed the sunset at the monument for a burned-out car carvass on the interstate, but Moab was cloud-crusted and blue by the time we got there anyway. Dry rain seems only fitting in the desert. Ate our PB and J dinner in the car, set up camp in the dark. Couldn’t even see the cliff we were under&em;more you could feel it.</p>
<p>Drove off post-sunrise with French capp and biscotti to hike into the canyons. Started on foot afternoon and immediately got lost into Lost Canyon (we think) which felt only appropriate. EC3 was near the only water source, God bless. No dirt for tent pegs so we lay matts out between canyon wall and boulder and fell asleep counting stars.</p>
<p>Awoke first to find I&rsquo;d stolen his pillow in the night. Snapped pics of the Sleeping Beauty and made breakfast before he was out of bed. Today&em; hiked through and over canyons. Got distracted by photos and bouldering and what-would-you-do-with-a-million (haunted house, enigmatic French wine maker). All the riverbeds are sand. All the plants have thorns. It&rsquo;s dry and red, all cards and canyons and afterglow.</p>
<p>This place doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>Finally reached our site&em;when I thought we never would, the post sprouted out of yet another dry creek bed. Set up camp quick like we&rsquo;re becoming used to, dinner in the half-dark. Put up the tent at the sound of thunder but when the clouds passed over and the night stayed warm, we took it down for another sleep under the stars.</p>

<h4>Day 14 - S14<br>
Big Spring, UT to Island in the Sky, UT</h4>
<p>Easy hike out of the canyon lands and a long drive to the other edge. We&rsquo;re in sky country now. Past few days have bene up and down the twists and crevices of the canyons, watching the sand erode before our eyes and under our feet. Walking through history. But we&rsquo;re on top of the canyons now&em;the drive up along dynamite-scarred switchbacks.</p>
<p>Watched the sunset at the Green River Overlook. A whole crowd of people came to watch it disappear behind the far edge of the canyon, entranced by the misty blue and sinking, settling reds. Shivering in the wind. Apparently there&rsquo;ll be a crowd again at Mesa Arch for sunrise. We&rsquo;re in good company.</p>
<p>(Accidentally) camped in someone else&rsquo;s site (again). Sharing for a reduced rate. This is becoming our norm.</p>
<p>And walking through the campground at night&em;the sun set and all of us eaten dinner&em;but do campgrounds, around the world, ever lose their magic? Always the faint smell of campfire. Constellations glowing despite a full&em;or nearly&em;moon, the Big Dipper, Orion, Cassiopeia. A couple playing cards by headlamp, radio softly chirping a play-by-play of the game, whatever team or sport it happens to be. An RV still with windows glowing, disembodied hands turning the page of a newspaper. And despite the minutes or hours (or other car parked in its drive), how familiar a campsite becomes. On the road, the brief home.</p>
<h4>Day 15 - S15<br>
Island in the Sky, UT to Arches, UT</h4>
<p>Got up before the sun this morning to watch it rise at Mesa Arch. There were a dozen or two photographers already there when we arrived, all speaking their native tongues, amidst mechanical clicking of the cameras. It would have been beautiful (and maybe it was, for a moment) if it had&rsquo;t been so irritating and claustrophobic, and so many of them taking ugly photos. Regardless, the sun rose as it always does. Beautiful and calm and full of promise as it always is.</p>
<p>We drank our hot chocolate in mittened hands and ate biscotti close on the cliff&rsquo;s edge. Left early to try and beat the line at Arches, all those weird geological formations calling our name.</p>
<p>Sun rising on the ride out, we watered watched the Wizard* trying to fly, blinded and lost as his Utopia hit the edge. Pulled up long enough to make sure he was okay and to send a wish that his car would drive again, but what could we do? No space even for hitchhikers.</p>
<p>At Arches now, and have been doing small hikes all day. Out here and up there, through the orange sand and warm rock. All these bizarre tunnels carved into walls of stone, thinned and smoothed over time.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re two of hundreds of thousands that will pass through these lands. Along the trail rocks and trees are worn smooth from the millions of hands that have touched them before us, also looking for balance or relief. We went barefoot along the sandy path of one of the trails, so at least if we are not remembered by the canyons and fins, the other passers-through will remember long enough to wonder.</p>
<p>Unshowered dust turning my ankles a splotchy reddish brown. Tanned during the day and shivering in the tent at night. Nails cut to the quick after days in the wild with them breaking. Only young people on the trails&em;by decades if not generations. All our peers back in class and only the elderly on tours surround us&em;liver spots and sun visors and varicose veins.</p>
<p>Part of me hoping I&rsquo;ll be like them, all my life&em;called to the open road and travelled trail. Part of me horrified at the prospect of getting old.</p>
<p>* The Wizard&em;caretaker of our million-dollar haunted house. Our guy from Canyonlands one end to the other.</p>
<h4>Day 17 - S17<br>
Coyote Gulch, UT</h4>
<p>We went to the Double Arch for sunset. The last arch we&rsquo;d seen, and by far the most beautiful. Towering spans of stone, looking and feeling like a cathedral awaiting a concert. All rough and jutting stone, catching those trying to climb her off balance. A drop on the other side of the arch, enough to force some to stay on their hands and knees.</p>
<p>We out-waited the crowds. Camera in hand, letting the arch fill with the eerie and and aching red of the desert.</p>
<p>As we left the park, we passed car after car pulled over to the shoulder. All these people stood outside, half-breathless, eyes filling with glow as the full moon rose over the Garden of Eden.</p>
<p>Waited until late afterglow faded out of the canyons and headed to Moab for greasy 24h Mexican food (and to pick up JJ&rsquo;s sleeping bag). Odd-not-odd being in town, surrounded by adventurers and ordinary folk while still salty with the desert&rsquo;s red dust.</p>
<p>Got back to camp to find our tent hand&rsquo;t been towed, and no fine despite us (&ldquo;forgetting&rsquo;) to pay the fee. On trend for our jailbreak escapes, we packed and left just after sunrise. Gas light came on almost as soon as we left the campsite, and its as another 25 km to the closest gas station. Thankful for the long, winding downhill slope, I kept the car in cruise and let Jon distract me with trap music and dedication songs.</p>
<p>Halfway to the ground, an indistinguishable marking in the sky transformed into a brightly coloured hot air balloon, making its own journey to the Island in the Sky. We re-hit the interstate, cutting through the utter desolation of the Utah desert. No ranches now, or towns or houses. Just scrubland and sand and strange twisted red stone lifting into the air.</p>
<p>We passed through Capitol Reef, one national park I was glad we were&rsquo;t staying at&em;though I was glad of the original Mormon settlers who played fruit orchards along the creek bed. I ripped a hole in my shorts running through the gate to grab handfuls of apples and pears.</p>
<p>Planned our trip (or re-planned, changing only the trailhead) with a ranger at the visitor&rsquo;s centre, grabbed a map and rode the washboard road to the trailhead.</p>
<p>Saw a coyote&em;at Coyote Gulch. Ears twitching, tail dark. Light-footed and slight and inquisitive.</p>
<p>Of all the parks and places so far, this one has been my favourite. The first few miles out of the trailhead were nothing spectacular&em;scrubland, desert, dried riverbeds and red rock. All things that had become so ordinary out here in the desert. But once into the gulch&em;goddamn. It was a absolutely awe-inspiring. The creek gurgling over red sand, the canyon walls curving up into the sky. Marching along the bottom of the creek with the willows and reeds, and hearing our voices echo-echo-echo. We set up camp, and went exploring with a day pack, walking amiably, kicking water as we went.</p>
<p>Arrived at Jacob Hamblin Arch to find near a dozen tents set up in its shadow. But what an arch. Bigger, more breathtaking than all 2,000 at Arches. Climbed to the top of its collapsed rubble and could feel the soft canyon breeze, see the river flower on either side. Hear the murmuring echo of the voices of the campers below. Got back to camp to find a surprisingly diurnal coyote had ravaged our food bag. Made dinner (sad) of scraps and snacks from our day pack, and re-planned our route. We learn from experience, and roll with the punches. So it goes.</p>
<p>Purified the water, packed bags. Ready to leave with the sun&rsquo;s light.</p>
<p>But our camp is charming, and the river quietly bubbling behind us. Stars and crickets and stoic canyon walls surround.</p>
<pWill check our shoes for scorpions in the morning.</p>
<h4>Day 18 - S18<br>
Escalante, UT</h4>
<p>Drove out, hiked out of the gulch. Stopped at an RV park on the edge of town with cheaper rates than the state park&em;plus showers and laundry. Spent the day getting clean, re-organizing, Jon writing/posting stories, me <i>finally</i> getting started on postcards. Wrote out our adventure so far on five cards, ready to be sent to Sharifa. God I miss her. Miss the comfort, miss the mischief.</p>
<p>Made bannock with jam in the wok. Sipping hot chocolate. Both of us quietly, happily journal, though on a wider picnic table than our rock of last night.</p>
<p>Going to curl up in the tent tonight, in our snuggle plush down sleeping bags, and watch <i>San Andreas</i>. That kind of camping. The sun has gone down now, the sky a dark murky blue. Rss have lights, glowing around us. There&rsquo;s a faint smell weed lingering in the air. Half a constellation peeking over the horizon. This is hilariously, regrettably delayed but:</p>
