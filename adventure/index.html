	<h3>&ldquo;I would be brave, for there is much to dare.&rdquo; &mdash; Raggers Creed</h3>
	
	<p>Adventure-based photographer and videographer. Sunriser. Wild-at-heart traveller. My bucket list is a work in progress. I focus on capturing raw, human-powered stories in wilderness environments in order to inspire and encourage other people to get outdoors. I&rsquo;m a semi-professional explorer&mdash;simultaneously paying the bills, planning the next bucket list item, and saving for that lens I&rsquo;ve got my eye on.</p>
	<p>Long game, though, this is a career. But not your typical hotshot lifestyle photographer. I aim to integrate my passion for the outdoors into my work with boys and young men with adventure-based programming that is centred on healthy and inclusive masculinities. More on that to come. For now, getting better at what I do and gathering a few stories to tell along the way.</p>

	<!-- I guide boys through outdoor experiences and feminism-based transformational masculinities. The themes I explore in my photography are ‘humans + wilderness’ (landscape images showing the interaction between people and the natural world) and ‘boys + tenderness’ (candid and raw images showing moments of closeness and support between boys and young men). My goal is create a body of work from these experiences that illustrates connection and interdependence in places we are often told they don’t exist. I believe that in a world in which division and isolation define both our societal relationship to the earth and traditional expectations for boys and men, this work is deeply needed. -->
