					<h1>Quotes</h1>
				</header>
				<p>This is an ongoing series of hand-selected quotes that I&rsquo;m really only putting online in order to make them more easily accessible for myself. But should anyone else come across them and draw some inspiration or comfort from them, I will be glad. Gathered from my own personal reading, from project-specific research around the web and from a photocopied booklet of wilderness reflections passed on to me by my friend Andr√©.</p>
				<blockquote>&ldquo;I would be brave, for there is much to dare.&rdquo; &mdash; Raggers Creed</blockquote>
				<blockquote>&ldquo;It is not the critic who counts, nor the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs and comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcomings, who knows the great devotion, who spends himself in a worthy cause, who at best knows in the end the high achievement of triumph and who at worst, if he fails while daring greatly, knows his place shall never be with those timid and cold souls who know neither victory nor defeat.&rdquo; &mdash; Theodore Roosevelt</blockquote>
				<blockquote>&ldquo;A human being should be able to heal a wound, plan an expedition, order from a French menu, climb a mountain face, enjoy a ballet, balance accounts, roll a kayak, embolden a friend, tell a joke, laugh at himself, cooperate, act alone, sing a children&rsquo;s song, solve equations, throw a dog a stick, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, love heartily, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.&rdquo; &mdash; Lew Hitcher</blockquote>
				<blockquote>&ldquo;Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?&rdquo; &mdash; Mary Oliver</blockquote>
				<blockquote>&ldquo;Always in a big woods when you leave familiar ground and step off into a new place there will be, along with feelings of curiosity and excitement, a little nagging of dread. It is the ancient fear of the unknown, and it is your first bond with the wilderness you are going into. What you are doing is exploring. You are undertaking the first experience of our essential loneliness for nobody can discover the world for anyone else. It is only after we have discovered it for ourselves that it becomes a common ground and a bond, and we cease to be alone.&rdquo; &mdash; Wendell Berry</blockquote>
				<blockquote>&ldquo;One final paragraph of advice: Do not burn yourselves out. Be as I am&mdash;a reluctant enthusiast, a part-time crusader, a half-hearted fanatic. Save the other half of yourselves and your lives for pleasure and adventur. It is not enough to fight for the land; it is even more important to enjoy it while you still can. While it&rsquo;s still there. So get out there and hunt and fish and mess aroung with your friends, ramble out yonder and explore the forests, encounter the grizz, climb the mountains, bag the peaks, run the rivers, breath deep of that yet sweet and lucid air, sit quietly for a while and contemplate the precious stillness,, that lovely mysterious and awesome space. Enjoy yourselves, keep your brain in your head and your head attached to your body, the body active and alive, and I promise you this one sweet victory over our enemies, over those desk-bound people with their hearts in a safe-deposit box and their eyes hypnotized by desk calculators. I promise you this: YOU WILL OUTLIVE THE BASTARDS.&rdquo; &mdash; Edward Abbey</blockquote>
				<blockquote>&ldquo;Life is a daring adventure, or it is nothing.&rdquo; &mdash; Helen Keller</blockquote>
				<blockquote>&ldquo;How often we speak of the great silences and of the importance of preserving them and the wonder of peace to be found there. When I think of them, I see the lakes and rivers of the north, the muskegs and expanses of tundra, the barren lands beyond all roads. I see the mountain ranges of the west and the high, rolling ridges of the Appalachians. I picture the deserts of the southwest and their brilliant panoramas of color, the impenetrable swamplands of the south. They will always be there and their beauty may not change, but should their silences be broken, they will never be the same.&rdquo; &mdash; Sigurd F. Olsen</blockquote>
