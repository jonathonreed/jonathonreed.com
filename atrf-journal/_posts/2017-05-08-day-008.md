Today's log is brought to you by (one of) the handsome human specimen(s) on these logs. "Asad you're so meta," is probably what you're thinking right now. I know. Or as the French would say, 'je sais' (which is pronounced 'jay say').

Jon thought this was a better photo, so I am including it because we're a team.*

We didn't start the biking component of our day till nearly midday. We were waiting to coordinate something in Gander, the next big town as we head West, it was a short distance and we'd been taken in by a lovely duo, Paul and Bonnie, in Glovertown. Making use of having a dining table, electrical outlets, and more reliable internet seemed like a good idea. Two consecutive nights of walls and a non-tent roof above our heads. Luxurious. Not to mention the hot shower(!).

Speaking of which, last evening as we rolled into town we bicycled past this incredible garage:

At which point I told Jonathon to keep going and invited myself over (suppertime!) to the home of a retired machinist from this neck of the woods who'd worked and lived in Labrador City for three decades. Good reminder of a lot of lessons such as how infallible health seems when you're young.

We had a radio interview on a show called 'Canada Now' shortly after noon which went really well. We'll post a link to the audio when we've got a copy. 

Other than that, it was a good day. Coldest one in the books so far. It was warm on the uphill ascents and cold on the downhill descents. 

Getting in the groove of things and feeling great. Just have to keep tinkering a little bit more and put on a brave face.

*It may disappear at some point down the road even though, don't tell him, I think it is the better photo. Mostly because of the CLIF bars.
