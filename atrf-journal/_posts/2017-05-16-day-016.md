Slept in a little and hit snooze a few times before rolling out of bed. I didn't sleep as much as I could've in Corner Brook and we didn't think we needed to push as much today. We were all packed, fed, and rolled out of camp shortly after 8 AM regardless.

It was a nice and scenic, overcast day, lots of room to think and feel. Stopped to talk to these two, Raymond and Nicholas, as they prepared one of the provincial parks for the onslaught of visitors who will start arriving in a few weekends.

It wasn't too long after that when we had some plans fall into place, thanks again to our incredible Lewisporte host, and we met Elder Calvin White from Flat Bay First Nation. 

We met him right on the TCH at a restaurant attached to an Ultramar gas station. What followed was one of the most insightful and gratifing conversations we've had with anyone since this trip began. Everthing from the Trudeau's 1969 White Paper to Justin Brake and Muskrat Falls to the role of education to the rhetoric of politicians and so much more. More on this soon.

It continued to rain and pour, giant blobs of this weird liquid life depends on; it's still raining against our tent walls as I type this. We ducked into our tent, which we put up in record time, behind a motel aptly called Midway Motel. We'll catch the ferry off Newfoundland towards Nova Scotia later tomorrow and what a wonderful timezone to have begun this all in.
