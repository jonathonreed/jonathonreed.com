It has been a perfect day. All of it, from breakfast to dinner to now, sipping on coffee in the gathering dusk. The events that follow are just the last quadrant of the day. Years ago, a local photographer in my university town invited me to a very transformational photowalk in the dead of winter. He and his wife have relocated to this neck of the woods in Chéticamp, so we decided to pay them a visit. It was a day steeped in splendour and serendipity and surprise, the universe writing poetry in all sorts of ways.

We were not only treated to a lobster dinner but also a drive to some very picturesque spots. Jonathon as usual got right up close.

We'll be picking up speed in the next few weeks so it's nice to soak up some of the salty smells, sights, and sounds while we can.
