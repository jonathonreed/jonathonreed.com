A day full of cycling. I've mentioned this a couple times already but I think my brain doesn't fully pay attention to the uphill parts, and then is fully aware of the downhill parts; so I end up with a strange uplifting feeling like I've spent most of the day going downhill.

It was a long day, but it didn't get too warm and after New Glasgow felt like the wind was mostly at our backs. I finished the podcast about the English Revolution. They executed King Charles I, then after a decade of failed parliaments and constitutional reforms crowned his son. Questionable to say the least.

*The title of this log comes from the sleep-inducing soundtrack I listened to after we finished cycling, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDFSG-fZPQ4">Belle et Sébastien</a>, and because Asad's really having a ball with his alternate language titles. Good to fall asleep tired.
