It was a perfect start to the day, on a farm in this neck of the woods I've been in love with for over a year. 

It was a rest day for my lower body but my upper body spent the day harvesting radishes, hakarai turnips, and spinach. It poured incessantly but the crew was incredibly cheerful and it was a treat to have dirt on my hands on a cold day.

It was tremendously wonderful to have a roaring fire at the end of it:

Jonathon spent the day chipping away on some incredible pieces: [Mi-Carême](http://astheravenfli.es/journal/2017/05/26/mi-careme/), [Paul Prosper, Chief of Paqtnkek Mi'kmaw Nation](http://astheravenfli.es/journal/2017/05/26/paul-prosper-chief-of-paqtnkek-first-nation/) and [Ocean Wind](http://astheravenfli.es/journal/2017/05/27/ocean-wind/).

We got our first two rolls of film which were shot in Newfoundland developed by the incredible folks at Downtown Camera. Posted <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BUnSwyElj5T/">a photoset on Instagram</a>.

Here are a few.

I went to sleep early, shivering, only to realize that I was in a bit of a feverish state. All was well the next morning but it was a tough night's sleep. Really good place to pit stop and get some emotional nutrition.
