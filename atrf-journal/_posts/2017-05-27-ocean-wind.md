"I find that time goes by really quickly when I'm travelling," I wrote in <a href="https://www.theoutbound.com/jonathonreed/why-i-keep-a-travel-journal-and-you-should-too" target="_blank">a post on The Outbound</a> a couple months ago. "The days are so full and they can run so quickly into each other that at the end I'm not sure if something happened this day or that day, or where exactly it happened, or who exactly I was with."

"Memories are fickle things. If you don't take care to record them, you'll lose them. Or at least, you'll lose the details, those small pieces that make your adventure so special."

With that in mind, I wrote up a small collection of stories on <a href="https://jonathonreed.exposure.co/" target="blank">Exposure</a>, to keep with me as I head farther west and onwards into the wild. Stories are special things, and telling them helps keep them close at hand and close to your heart.

<blockquote>The one thing that every single sunrise and sunset has in common is that they donâ€™t stay for long. It felt like just minutes before I could tell that the colours were fading into blue. For every panorama I shot, for every wave that rolled onto shore, it was like I could feel the earth spinning away from the sun and towards the night. The day of grey sky had concluded in a breathtaking whirlwind of orange and pink and purple, but it had concluded nonetheless. Night was on its way.</blockquote>
