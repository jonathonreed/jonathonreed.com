Much to say but words will fall short, particularly in the tired state I'm writing this in. An almost perfect feeling was holding a cup of peppermint tea as we got off the ferry into the sunset. 

We're also in the month of Ramadan now, something I always miss sharing with my family. And yet, and yet.

We found ourselves, late at night, beside a lighthouse, with too many presents to mention. All this is a tremendous gift. I hope we someday grow up to be worthy of it all. But not yet, and yet.
