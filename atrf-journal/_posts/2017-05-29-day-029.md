Left a delicious breakfast on the east coast of the island to let the sun lead us west. Stopped in the local post office, crossed Murray River and then followed the narrow highway up one hill and down the next. Up and down, avoiding the cracks and patches as best we could. According to a local, the uneven asphalt is because the island is essentially a sandbar. Soft ground means not-so-easy paving.

We got to Charlottetown by mid-afternoon and worked for a while in a downtown coffeeshop arranging the logistics of the upcoming few days on the island. Doing our best to keep the road unfolding before us. Then headed up to a host family whom Asad met and shared a meal with on his last tour across Canada.

On one of our last hills, a motorcyclist roared past us as we pedalled diligently. Asad didn't shake his fist. "Show-off!" he called.

Showers, a brief taste of yoga, a tour of a local farm, a clouded-over sunset at Cavendish. And yes, more rhubarb crisp.
