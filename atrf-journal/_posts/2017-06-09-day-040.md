It was our earliest start yet, we had a long day ahead. We're two days behind schedule and by the end of the day we'll be just one day behind. We were on the road by 6:45 AM, rising with the sun.

We've been making (train) tracks and it is great to feel so fortunate in regards to being healthy enough to be able to pull some of the long days we have and (fingers crossed, inchAllah) the ones which we are yet to have.

There is a beautiful book called [the World Without Us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_Without_Us) and I often find myself wondering the question that is central to that book, what would this place look like if we humans disappeared overnight? Nature is constantly trying to reclaim the landscape. Not that we as humans, and we forget this often, are separate from nature.

We bicycled past this 'flowerbed' and I almost fell off my bike in sheer amusement and delight. My kinda person whoever put this out here. Some of the most beautiful garden beds have been along this route. I'm always glad to take a smaller highway to get to our destination. More hills, more scenic, but always worth it. Well, most of the time.

Stoic in determination, they refused to make any comments.

I stopped to chat with a retired forest ranger in the village limits of where we are staying and we had a lovely chat spanning a wide range of topics, including the home for his former cat.

Our host from Fredericton offered us her place, a gorgeous A-frame house, and I don't know if there is any other word which feels more appropriate than to say that we are blessed. It is a rare event for Jonathon and I to have walls and a roof around us and no one else in the house. Hoping for some serious productivity on the computer tomorrow.

With a freshload of laundry done, with much love as always.
