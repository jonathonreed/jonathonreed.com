A few weeks ago we spent a couple nights at Abundant Acres, a farm in rural Nova Scotia. I spent a not-rainy afternoon practicing flying the drone and ended up putting together a short video about the farm.

David had been working since 4 AM, so at the end of the long day he was missing his usual verve; it was my first time flying the drone, so it's missing a bit of finesse. But I think it would be a shame not to share some footage of this beautiful part of the Bay of Fundy coastline, despite it being unpolished and unperfected. It was a privilege to be among the smell of rain-wet mud and blooming lilacs. Even more of a privilege to edit this beside a burning woodstove.

Again, practice. I wouldn't show this video otherwise but I deeply appreciate David and Jen's hospitality. Plus I nearly ran into a skunk while flying the drone. Thank you, Nova Scotia.
