We woke up with the intention of hitting the road. I slept in a little having stayed up late to finish not one but two reports that I've been unable to finish writing for two incredible organizations whom I owe a tremendous amount to. 

I told Jonathon and myself that we weren't leaving till I was done. When else on this trip would we have the type of ideal working environment that we did? I didn't finish till 5 PM so we decided to stick around another day. 

It felt more than frustrating to be stuck at a screen while the weather outside looked perfect. I'm tremendously glad to be done the overdue work I've been carrying emotionally and mentally the past few provinces.

It felt really great to go for a walk and get that tub of ice cream and large jug of chocolate milk. I'll regret this later.

Another glorious sunset and I am reminded several times that there is no reason to be whiny, nothing to complain about, my problems are all rather superficial. La vie est belle.

It does feel like the birds know something I don't. But I always feel that way about them.
