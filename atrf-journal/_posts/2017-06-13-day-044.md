We were up and at it early. Lovely to have the extra hour of sleep due to the timezone shift. Jonathon had asked someone if we could camp on their property and they obliged. Headed into the crowded parts of the country we are. I am tremendously impressed by the consistent small-scale food production here in Quebec. Tremendously so. Incroyable.

Some odd sights in all sorts of shapes.

Two photos of me before starting this expedition and now. Please notice the difference in leg muscle tone and length.

Yesterday we saw several log trucks and I scrambled to photograph them, today it was wind turbine blades. After unsuccessfully trying to photograph two as they ZIPPED by, I caught one waiting in line.

We are being hosted today by George and Nikki Hayes who have a family farm for beef production (primarily, a few other things as well). Among many hats, George is also a school commissioner with the anglophone board and was away for most of the day for their monthly meeting. So we mostly pestered the lovely and extremely patient Nikki.

Also talked to several of the farm employees.

They mostly played along well together.

Since he didn't cower down, love at first sight for Jonathon.

One of the two bulls on the farm, Dozer.

They have a very cozy and homely place here. Much more can be written about it's wondrousness and the music festival their daughter started which coincides with the town fair. More on that in another post. I promise.

Remarking on the phone yesterday to a friend, I'm excited to have my own garden in a season not too distant.
