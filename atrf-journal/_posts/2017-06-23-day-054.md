We rolled out a little s-l-o-w, I'm not entirely sure why but I think we perhaps suspected how long the day would be.

We had a call with our terrific bicycle sponsors, Vanhawks, and Jonathon zoomed away while I ran into someone who started their trip from St. John's almost two weeks after us. The weather forecast for him hadn't been as pleasant. Harold Earle of Earle Industries had told him about us! His son flew in from Vancouver to Quebec City to cycle tour till Ottawa with his dad. Neat-o. We pitstopped for a quick cup of coffee, a chocolatine, and then parted ways.

Not too long after this I ran into a mother-daughter duo cycling from north of Kingston to Quebec city, we exchanged some stories from the road and then parted ways. 30 seconds into the conversation, the daughter said that I must be a veteran of the road because of the bicycle set-up as well as my manner of inquiry. I'll take it.

We've pulled some long and tough days in the last ten days. Part of the rush is to catch Eid prayers in a city as well as potentially sneaking in a trip to the Greater Toronto Area to surprise family. It feels easy on this tour to feel like a minion of these plans or to wish for a motor on the bike.

Ottawa will be a good pitstop for the body, just as I know Montreal will be for my soul. It always has been.
