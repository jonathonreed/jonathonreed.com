It is the first day of the Faith in Canada 150 Conference which we'd been racing to Ottawa to get to in time. It's held at the Global Centre for Pluralism where we biked to early in the morning and were let in through the backdoor by the lovely Calina. I do not have a photo of her but I have an old photo of [a beautiful dress](https://www.instagram.com/p/BKqtjltAaZI/) from many moons ago. 

I'm still amazed (even though I knew she would be here) that Jessica Bolduc of [4RS](http://4rsyouth.ca/) is around.

Saw someone with a really beautifully designed umbrella across the hallway so I couldn't help but photograph her and requisition a model by the name of Andrew Phillips to hold it.

Colour coordination (somewhat) on the shirts but not so much the pants.

My forever-dear-friend and once-landlord drove in from Kingston to split a bottle of Perrier sparkling water and I had the chance to be navigator for a change.

There are some beautiful people in Ottawa, most of whom came to visit the Elgin Street Diner while I spent another evening passing the hours there.

Still have a lot of work to do on the whistling and non-whistling front.
