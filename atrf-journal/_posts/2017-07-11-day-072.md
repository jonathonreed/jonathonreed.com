Whenever there is a bed to sleep in, my body takes its time rolling out. I don't mind this much. You take your hours of rest when you can and the Soo has been an unexpected balm on a lot of levels. This home and its inhabitants, in particular. A house, a home. Hmmm.

I rolled into the town (again) to park myself at a beautiful spot to work on the fourth episode of our podcast, [now online for your listening pleasure](http://astheravenfli.es/journal/2017/07/11/flight-04/), but heard from my friend, the talented multidisciplinary artist [Rihkee Strapp](https://www.facebook.com/RihkeeStrapp/) that we could go swing by the Dawaa Dazhi Gallery to see their contribution to the exhibit.

When I returned to the spot where I spent the next few hours editing audio, I met Gio and Cleis. Interacting with them a little while trying to focus on the work at hand (presence or productivity?), there was a wealth of wisdom and knowledge in these two who had two of the most beautiful voices I've ever had.

27 years ago, to this day, [the Oka Crisis](http://astheravenfli.es/journal/2017/06/28/oka/) began. It felt very poetic then to have been in attendance at Algoma University, a former residential school, listening to [the Bawating Water Protectors](https://www.facebook.com/BawatingWaterProtectors/) about their reoccupation of Parliament Hill with ceremony, the tipi, and the fire.

It started to rain lightly as the event came to a close and one of the water protectors, Cleis, whose father had caught all the fish which we'd had for dinner, sang us the Buffalo Song, and I learned of how an Eagle Feather was earned and who had presented it. What a day.
