I met him on his way from New Brunswick to Alberta to visit his son. We talked about many things but what caught my eye was the handmade bracelets on his wrist.

"They're from my two granddaughters back home. I get funny looks for wearing them, you know, other men thinking I'm gay. Really. But I don't care about that, I never had a problem with gay people. The bracelets are a way to stay close with my granddaughters, even when I'm far away."

Homophobia all too often destabilizes men's ability to be nurturing and loving, so it's important to acknowledge and support those qualities where we see them. Even in something as small and as simple as two handmade bracelets.
