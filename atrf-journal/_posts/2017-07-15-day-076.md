We woke up to the sound of waves, beautiful and incredible spot, and the bugs weren't too bad. We started zigging and zagging. Wawa wasn't too far and as I pulled in towards the Canada Goose, two adorable kids were waving at me. I waved back but my jaw dropped when I saw who the parents were.

Jon and Adri are two dear friends of mine and I first (and last) saw them about 400 km west near Thunder Bay. They were on their honeymoon and at that time, four years ago, bicycling from Calgary to Montreal. Now here they were, with two beautiful children looking and seeming more full and complete than they did years ago. Here I was, still on a bicycle.

There were other cyclists.

Familiar family members.

Peletons headed in the opposite direction.

People who maintained winter roads at the end of the road bordering the Arctic Ocean.
