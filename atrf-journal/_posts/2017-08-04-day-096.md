When I spent some time with Ryan McMahon in Winnipeg he showed me to me some of the artifacts and gifts in his bundles. One of them was a Treaty 4 Medallion which he was presented with after his time spent in Treaty Studies. 

He'd just freshly recieved a medallion from [Justin Jacob Louis](https://www.sectionthirtyfive.com/) which was titled 'Glitch in the Treaty', the next few posts from Jonathon and me should be taken with a similar 'Glitch in the Timeline' or #GlitchInTheTimeline theme. I'm flying back to Toronto for a few days (or so I thought) to attend a wedding. It'll be pretty jam-packed but there is an exhibit at the Art Gallery of Ontario which a friend of mine co-curated which I'm hoping to attend as well. Over the years working on projects, I've learned to give myself wiggle room to balance presence over productivity. In the long run, I try to weigh out using a 'Regret Minimization Framework' what I'd regret missing out on. It isn't always feasible and there are tradeoffs to everything.

I am traveling with cats, whose caretakers have fishing poles, and befriending flight attendants. Serendipidously, my adopted aunt, Jay Pitter, has just gotten back into town from some work-travel and we'll have dinner. It was a scrumptious meal and I had some time with her I wrote about this on Facebook, about feeling grateful to have some elephant whisperers in my life, who speak to these heavyweights I carry around on my chest which I'm not always aware of, and help me breathe easier.

Aunt Jay's daughter is a very accomplished artist who goes by the moniker DJ Bambi and I swung by the club, something I never do, to say hello.
