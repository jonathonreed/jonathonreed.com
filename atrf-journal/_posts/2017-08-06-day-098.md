A good metric of success in life, I think, is how many weddings you are invited to and I'm at the point in my life, already somehow, where folks are tying knots. I'd missed quite a few this year already so with Daniel + Nadine, a very special couple, I couldn't pass up the chance since we were hoping to be in Edmonton and I could reasonably fly out to be in attendance. Ended up having to hitch a ride to make it to my flight from Saskatoon to Edmonton mais c'est la vie! Not used to having this kind of lateral room in regards to space and time.

One of my hopes for the wedding was to run into my dear friends, Elamin + Emily, which worked out! We were all even at the same table at the dinner reception. Here is Elamin explaining and evaluating strategy to and with a four-year old.

A beautiful wedding by every measure, not that this is the type of feeling you can measure. Worth the trek all of it, every morsel even if it was in morse code.
