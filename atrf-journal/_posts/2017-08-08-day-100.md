Channeling one of my favourite photographers, [Taha Mahuruma](http://instagram.com/tahaphoto), as I wander the streets of Toronto. 

My Aunt Jay Pitter invited me to gathering in Montreal North this upcoming weekend so I changed my flight plans. Jonathon is going to hit the road as planned and I will play catch-up. The parameters of this gathering, Hoodstock, which are rooted in a young man killed by the police and the riots which followed 9 years ago fit in very well with the original ethos of As The Raven Flies. It is also a community I know nothing about. So I have some breathing space in Toronto to chip away on my Fall to-do list before heading off to Montreal. 

One of the perks is being reunited with one of my oldest and dearest friends, [Fatin Chowdhury](http://instagram.com/fatinic). It is an important time to be alive and beautifully so to be around the likes of him and all the other kick-ass poets and poems being birthed and created in periods like these.
