Left Liard after sleeping in for a bit because of the lingering rain. Then came the hills northwest towards the Yukon border. The road follows the Liard River for the most part, so there's a slow-moving reminder that you're going ever-so-slightly uphill. 

I didn't take many photos because I was a little sad to have left the mountains (for now), and because I'm writing on my own laptop I don't have access to Asad's photos. So there was this one rather small monument to the surveyors of the Alaska Highway. Highlight of the day was absolutely seeing my first Canada lynx I'd ever seen in my life. It's my favourite animal but I had never seen it in real life. It ran across the highway in front of me, then stopped and watched me from the bushes. I whispered to it a little message for the wild.
