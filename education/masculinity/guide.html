	<p>Working with young people isn&rsquo;t easy in pretty much any context. You need intuition, practice, intentionality. With all youth. But I&rsquo;m going to go out on a limb and say that with boys in particular, you need a well-honed skillset. The training of traditional masculinity has led most boys to develop the tools and desire to keep their mouths closed and their guards up.</p>
	<p>So for any boy, if you&rsquo;re going to effectively go up against a lifetime of implicit and explicit messages perpetuating tenets of hegemonic masculinity, you need to know what you&rsquo;re doing. Or at least a start.</p>
	<p>That&rsquo;s what this page is meant to beâ€”a start. Obviously I don&rsquo;t know everything. Obviously there are dozens or more books out there that are more comprehensive and detailed. This is just me. Plus my own academic research and extensive experience, but still just me. But I haven&rsquo;t found anything like a connecting-with-boys guide online that wasn&rsquo;t outdated or problematically based on traditional masculinity, so I&rsquo;m filling in at least part of that gap. No one&rsquo;s asked me to, and I kind of wish someone would.</p>

	<p><em>Asking hard questions</em><br>
		So you&rsquo;ve done the easy part of asking the question. The hard part is often pulling out, listening to and understanding the answer. Because of society&rsquo;s boys-don&rsquo;t-cry rhetoric, a lot of boys are lack skills in both identifying and expressing their emotions. They know that. It feels wrong. It&rsquo;s hard, it&rsquo;s awkward. So a bit of self-defence comes into play.</p>
		<p>The half-answer: This one is tricky, because it might seem at first that he&rsquo;s answered your question. To pick up on a half-answer, you really have to know what you were asking. Does his answer address it or dance around it? (For example, I ask a young teenager whom I know is feeling sad if he wants to talk on the phone. He responds with: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ok. We don&rsquo;t have to.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a half-answer. I didn&rsquo;t ask if we <i>had</i> to, I asked if he <i>wanted</i> to. I point that out to him, and within a minute the phone rings.)
