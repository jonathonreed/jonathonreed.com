	<h1><div align="center">Introduction</div></h1>
		<p>Working with young people isn&rsquo;t easy in pretty much any context. You need intuition, practice, intentionality. With all youth. But I&rsquo;m going to go out on a limb and say that with boys in particular, you need a well-honed skillset. The experience of traditional masculinity has led most boys to develop the tools and motivation to keep their mouths closed and their guards up.</p>
		<p>So for any boy, if you&rsquo;re going to effectively go up against a lived experience of implicit and explicit messages perpetuating tenets of hegemonic masculinity, you need to know what you&rsquo;re doing. Or at least a start.</p>
		<p>That&rsquo;s what this page is meant to be—a start. Obviously I don&rsquo;t know everything. Obviously there are dozens or more books out there that are more comprehensive and detailed. This is just me. Plus my own academic research and extensive experience, but still just me. And to be honest, I haven&rsquo;t found anything like a connecting-with-boys guide online that wasn&rsquo;t outdated or problematically based on traditional masculinity, so I&rsquo;m filling in at least part of that gap. No one&rsquo;s asked me to, and I kind of wish someone would.</p>
		<p>Verb-based subtitles apply either to you or to the hypothetical boy. All examples are true. Last updated in January 2017.</p>

	<h3 id="relationship">Building relationship</h3>
		<p>While there are obviously key differences between intergenerational and peer relationships, I think any effective adult&rsquo;s relationship with a young person should have the same key elements of communication and support that characterize any kind of friendship.</p>
		<p>This is absolutely the case with boys, who&mdash;despite traditional media portrayals or convincing outward acts of indifference&mdash;are deeply relational. I do hesitate to make sweeping generalizations like that, but there is a such a pervasive narrative of boys being singly action-oriented straight-talkers that it&rsquo;s worth acknowledging the importance of platonic relationships in their lives. You are not going to have a constructive impact on a boy without his trust, admiration and love.</p>
		<p>Think of the relationship like a bank account, with every statement of support being a deposit into the account.</p>
	
		<p><em>Spending time</em><br>
		This is both obvious and complex. It&rsquo;s clear that you can&rsquo;t build a strong relationship without putting in the time to do so, but how you go about doing that with a boy can be nuanced. Boys often value their independence and peer relationships, so there&rsquo;s a natural instinct to give them space. If you&rsquo;re working on building your relationship, however, don&rsquo;t wait for him to come to you. Be willing to reliably and flexibly offer your attention, even when it doesn&rsquo;t appear to be needed. Offer to spend time together. If he says yes, don&rsquo;t let him down. If he says no, ask again some other time.</p>
		<p>There&rsquo;s a general belief that the key to connecting with boys is through action. I find this to be helpful but not definitive. I&rsquo;ve had a lot of success easily bonding through activity-based shared time, like playing basketball or canoeing; but I&rsquo;ve also had boys who, given the choice, have preferred to just sit and talk. My advice is to offer a bit of both. Get buy-in by having fun, but make it clear that you can be serious and quiet as well.</p>
		<blockquote><p>In my role as Head Counsellor at summer camp I identify a certain boy for whom I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on &lsquo;inside.&rsquo; I talk with him a bit and he indicates that his feeling towards me is that I&rsquo;m too busy for him. I spend the next couple evenings hanging out in his cabin while he and his friends play a board game, and when he asks I tell him that I&rsquo;m there because I want to get to know him better. I&rsquo;m adept enough that my presence isn&rsquo;t intrusive and I don&rsquo;t overstay, I just spend some time. After two or three hang-outs, he asks if I can come visit him in the evening. When I arrive, he&rsquo;s busy, so I tell him where I&rsquo;ll be nearby and to come get me when he&rsquo;s free. When he comes to find me, he tries to change his mind by saying it&rsquo;s not a big deal and I probably have other things to do. I tell him that I&rsquo;m there for him. He spends the next two hours talking about feeling bullied and physically targeted by another boy and feeling like he should be able to handle it on his own. We continue to check in about what&rsquo;s going on for him for the remainder of the camp session.</p></blockquote>
	
		<p><em>Giving compliments</em><br>
		Again, mostly obvious but worth mentioning. Authentic positive language goes a long way, even if you don&rsquo;t realize it at the time&mdash;but it has to be authentic and specific. Studies have shown that vague compliments like &lsquo;you&rsquo;re awesome&rsquo; actually have a negative impact on a boy (or any kid) who has low self-esteem, because he doesn&rsquo;t know why you think he&rsquo;s awesome, doesn&rsquo;t really believe it and therefore you lose credibility with him. By contrast, compliments that are specific make it clear what you like about him and that you really mean it.</p>
		<p>In the camp world is a tool called &lsquo;targeted validation,&rsquo; which is a practice of describing an action that a kid did, labelling it for the positive character trait that it demonstrated, and praising them for it. It&rsquo;s more for behaviour management than relationship building, but it&rsquo;s effective with both. Worth keeping in mind that praising an action is often more impactful than praising a characteristic.</p>
		<blockquote><p>An eleven-year-old I didn&rsquo;t know that well made an offhand comment about how he didn&rsquo;t think anyone would be his partner in a game because he was stupid. I thought he was joking so I didn&rsquo;t take it that seriously; just laughed and told him he wasn&rsquo;t, that he was creative and fun and had good ideas, made sure that he had a willing partner and then forgot about it. Later his mom told me that he went back to her that day like he couldn&rsquo;t believe it and said, &ldquo;Mom, guess what, Jonathon said I&rsquo;m not stupid!&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
	
	<h3 id="questions">Asking questions</h3>
		<p>Asking a question for which you want a deep answer is important. One one hand it&rsquo;s really quite simple and often the hardest part is just saying the words out loud. But on the other hand it can be complex, and important to do correctly. In some cases the way in which you ask the question can have a major impact on whether or not you get the truth.</p>
		
		<p><em>Making space</em><br>
		Sometimes asking a boy a question doesn&rsquo;t mean specifically asking anything at all. I don&rsquo;t mean this to be a way to avoid saying hard stuff—&lsquo;making space&rsquo; is not an easy way out but a specific tool to be used intentionally. Usually if a question is important, it&rsquo;s important to say out loud. However, if you think that asking explicitly will make it too intimidating for him to answer truthfully, you can start by implicitly making space for what you suspect could be his tough answer.</p>
		<p>Because of traditional masculinity, boys often have a strong belief that they need to handle their feelings independently—and because so many boys and men do this, boys also often have the impression that they are the only ones feeling the way they&rsquo;re feeling. This is why making space is important. It demonstrates that &lsquo;unmasculine&rsquo; feelings are okay and worth talking about, and that the hard expectations of hegemonic masculinity are not your expectations and therefore not applicable to the space you share together.</p>
			<blockquote><p>I spend time with a boy whom I know is dealing with homophobic bullying, and I notice that he&rsquo;s saying a lot of transparently heterosexual and traditionally masculine things (e.g. how hot a female actor is or that a car is gay). I make space for alternative sexualities while we&rsquo;re together by commenting on good-looking male actors and explicitly shutting down his homophobic comments, and the next day I message him: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to say all that heterosexual stuff with me.&rdquo; Later in the evening he tells me that he&rsquo;s never told anyone, but he thinks he might be gay.</blockquote>
	
		<p><em>Checking communication</em><br>
		It&rsquo;s not uncommon that a boy will deflect a question by telling you that everything is fine and/or whatever you were asking about is inaccurate. Don&rsquo;t let that be how the conversation ends. The risk is that if he has decided to hide something from you, it will be even harder for him to reveal it when he changes his mind. If he thinks you believed his act of bravado, he will likely feel reluctant to give that up and, more powerfully, guilty that he lied.</p>
		<p>The solution to this is to check his communication with you by making it clear that if there is something that he&rsquo;s hiding, you are always ready to hear it. The purpose of this is to ensure that what lingers with him from your conversation is your accessibility and support, rather than his bravado.</p>
			<blockquote><p>A boy who has isolated himself and appears to be feeling down tells me unconvincingly that nothing is going on. I say okay, then wait a moment. &ldquo;If there was something going on,&rdquo; I ask, &ldquo;would you tell me?&rdquo; He hesitates, then says, &ldquo;That depends.&rdquo; He won&rsquo;t say what it depends on, and after about a minute of silence, I put a hand on his shoulder and tell him that I will always be there to support him. Within a week he asks me to talk about what&rsquo;s been getting him down.</p></blockquote>
	
		<p><em>Fishing</em></p>
	
	<h3 id="listening">Listening</h3>
		<p>Asking the question is hard. Understanding the answer is sometimes just as challenging. Because of society&rsquo;s boys-don&rsquo;t-cry rhetoric, a lot of boys are lack skills in both identifying and expressing their emotions. They know that. It feels wrong. It&rsquo;s hard, it&rsquo;s awkward. They think they shouldn&rsquo;t (or can&rsquo;t) answer, so often they&rsquo;ll do their best not to.</p>
	
		<p><em>Mirroring</em></p>
	
		<p><em>Waiting out silence</em><br>
		A boy staying silent might seem like the worst, most uncomfortable thing, but at least he&rsquo;s not telling you to fuck off. It could definitely be worse. My first bit of advice is to get comfortable with silence. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with not saying words—you&rsquo;re saying a lot just by being there. Often as communicative adults we get uncomfortable with an &lsquo;awkward silence&rsquo; so we feel the need to fill it with unnecessary words. Ask yourself if you would be talking to make him feel better, or yourself feel better. If it&rsquo;s the latter, don&rsquo;t.</p>
		<p>If I need the conversation to move forward, I would start with simple yes-or-no questions, a guess at how he&rsquo;s feeling, a short story or a tour of the stickers on my waterbottle. Questions are best. Once he starts talking, it will be harder for him to stop.</p>
			<blockquote><p>A boy who I know is very sad has his head down in a pillow. I ask him if he&rsquo;s okay, he doesn&rsquo;t respond. I ask him if he can talk, he doesn&rsquo;t respond. I whisper to him if he can breathe, he doesn&rsquo;t respond. I put my hand on his back and feel him take a breath, then tell him, &ldquo;Yep, you&rsquo;re breathing.&rdquo; I wait for a bit, and ask him if he wants his back rubbed or no. He says yes through the pillow. Then I sit with him, stay silent, and wait for him to talk.</p></blockquote>
	
		<p><em>Managing a change of subject</em><br>
		Changing the subject is one of the most-used ways of avoiding something you don&rsquo;t want to talk about. It&rsquo;s a get-out-of-jail(-free) card. As such, it&rsquo;s a tool, and sometimes you&rsquo;ve got to remember that he might really need that tool—he might be signalling, intentionally or not, that he&rsquo;s not ready to talk. The first step to handling a subject change is to notice it. (Which, for the record, is easier said than done.) Then you have to quickly decide if you&rsquo;re going to let him get away with it or not. From his words and his body language, you should be able to tell if he can handle the difficult conversation or not. If he can, I won&rsquo;t let him change the subject. If he can&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll follow him—but I&rsquo;ll often let him know that I noticed the subject change, just so he knows he&rsquo;s not fooling me.</p>
		<p>This gets tough if he tries to change the subject to something else you want to talk about. Then it becomes a question of priority. When a boy is letting you have glimpses of his complex inner life, whether on purpose or not, you have to bookmark the things you want to come back to. Decide which conversation is more important, and keep going.</p>
			<blockquote><p>I tell a boy who punched a wall that I&rsquo;m glad he punched a wall and not a person, and that level of self-control must not have been easy. He doesn&rsquo;t answer. I ask him if he can tell me what made him upset, and he tells me he thinks he might have broken his hand. I give him a few seconds of changed subject as well as an escape route, responding that he probably did actually break his hand and asking if it hurts a lot, to which he says it&rsquo;s okay. (He could have said it hurt too bad to talk—at which point I would have known that even if he <i>was</i> faking it hurting that bad, he would be doing so at the cost of his stoicism, which would mean both that he was really serious about not being ready to talk and that I could demonstrate that I care about him—but he doesn&rsquo;t use the way out.) So after a few seconds I bring the conversation back to what happened to upset him.</p></blockquote>
	
		<p><em>Identifying a half-answer</em><br>
		A half-answer is when he answers a question that&rsquo;s slightly different than the one you asked. This one is sometimes hard to notice, because it might seem at first like he&rsquo;s answered your question. To pick up on a half-answer, you really have to know what you were asking. Does his answer address it or avoid it? If he&rsquo;s avoiding it, do you know why? Depending on the context, I&rsquo;ve responded to a half-answer by playfully rephrasing the question, asking if it&rsquo;s hard to talk about (in order to talk about why it&rsquo;s hard) or gently telling him that&rsquo;s not what I asked.</p>
			<blockquote><p>I ask a young teenager whom I know is feeling sad if he wants to talk on the phone. He responds with: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ok. We don&rsquo;t have to.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a half-answer. I didn&rsquo;t ask if we <i>had</i> to, I asked if he <i>wanted</i> to. I point that out to him, and within a minute the phone rings.</p></blockquote>
			<blockquote><p>A teenager is telling me about his friend spending a lot of time with a new girlfriend. I ask him how that makes him feel. He says: &ldquo;Well, he seems pretty happy about it and it&rsquo;s good that he has a girlfriend.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a half-answer. I didn&rsquo;t ask about his friend, I asked about him. I ask again, emphasizing <i>you</i>. He tells me he feels lonely and let down.</p></blockquote>
	
		<p><em>Responding to indifference</em><br>
		If he&rsquo;s acting indifferent, the key word here is likely &lsquo;acting.&rsquo; A boy will often work very hard to convince you that something doesn&rsquo;t matter to him—especially because if he can convince you, he can convince himself. What you need to keep in mind is that his supposed indifference is coming from an incorrect, inadequate notion of hegemonic masculinity that says to be a real man, he can&rsquo;t let himself be hurt. Not meeting that ideal of invulnerability can be almost as painful as being hurt in the first place. With that in mind, your goal is not for him to break down and cry, but for him to acknowledge that he cares.</p>
		<p>With different nuances depending on the boy or the situation, I would meet indifference with simple observations and questions about his experience, and what he wants. Yes-or-no questions are fine. By getting him to think critically about how he feels and how he wants to feel, I can bring him on board with communicating that and working to change it.</p>
			<blockquote><p>A boy who is getting bullied tells me it doesn&rsquo;t matter when I bring up the subject of what to do about the bullies. He thinks there&rsquo;s nothing to be done and he should just be &lsquo;strong&rsquo; enough to get over it independently. I ask him if he wants them to stop and he says he doesn&rsquo;t care. I ask him if he likes it when they make fun of him, he says no. I ask him if it makes him feel good, he says no. &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; I tell him, &ldquo;you do care.&rdquo; He reluctantly agrees that it does matter, but says he doesn&rsquo;t know what to do.</p></blockquote>
	
		<p><em>Responding to anger</em><br>
		Acting angry is another act. First of all, don&rsquo;t let it get to you. I&rsquo;m an extremely skilled and loved youth worker and I&rsquo;ve been sworn at more times than I can remember. So don&rsquo;t give up on an angry boy. For many boys, anger is a defense mechanism. From media, role models and peers, most boys have internalized a message that the only acceptable &lsquo;manly&rsquo; emotion is anger. So if they act angry and push away feelings of sadness, for example, they succeed in maintaining their masculine identity. But it comes at a price. That price is, of course, isolation.</p>
		<p>Boys who are isolated can become dangerous, either to themselves or others. Therefore your challenge with an angry boy is to decide first of all how authentic his anger is, and if it is truly not an act, how safe he is. If I think it&rsquo;s a mask and there&rsquo;s some other feelings that he&rsquo;s hiding behind his anger, I will attempt to remove that mask by asking him questions about his anger until it&rsquo;s clear that both of us know there&rsquo;s something else going on. If I think he really is angry and the emotional noise inside him will drown out anything I try to say to him, I will give him space, but only enough space so that he can process things on his own—not so much that he thinks he&rsquo;s pushed me away. Once he&rsquo;s emotionally ready, I will start a conversation about what made him feel that way.</p>
			<blockquote><p>A boy at a mealtime at summer camp is acting sullen and refusing to interact with anyone, and from a distance I can see his emotions rising. Intervening before he snaps at another boy, I take him for a break outside and ask him what&rsquo;s going on between him and the other boy. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s pissing me off,&rdquo; he says angrily. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re feeling pissed off?&rdquo; I echo back at him. He starts to tell me what happened, and as he talks his eyes fill with tears and roll down his cheeks.</p></blockquote>
