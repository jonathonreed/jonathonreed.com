		<p>Working with young people isn&rsquo;t easy in pretty much any context. You need intuition, practice, intentionality. With all youth. But I&rsquo;m going to go out on a limb and say that with boys in particular, you need a well-honed skillset. The training of traditional masculinity has led most boys to develop the tools and desire to keep their mouths closed and their guards up.</p>
		<p>So for any boy, if you&rsquo;re going to effectively go up against a lifetime of implicit and explicit messages perpetuating tenets of hegemonic masculinity, you need to know what you&rsquo;re doing. Or at least a start.</p>
		<p>That&rsquo;s what this page is meant to be—a start. Obviously I don&rsquo;t know everything. Obviously there are dozens or more books out there that are more comprehensive and detailed. This is just me. Plus my own academic research and extensive experience, but still just me. But I haven&rsquo;t found anything like a connecting-with-boys guide online that wasn&rsquo;t outdated or problematically based on traditional masculinity, so I&rsquo;m filling in at least part of that gap. No one&rsquo;s asked me to, and I kind of wish someone would.</p>

	<h3 id="questions">Asking questions</h3>
		<p>Asking a question for which you want a deep answer is an important move. One one hand it&rsquo;s really quite simple and often the hardest part is just saying the words out loud. But on the other hand it can be complex, and important to do correctly. In some cases the way in which you ask the question can have a major impact on whether or not you get the truth.</p>
		<p><em>Making space</em><br>
		Sometimes asking a boy a question doesn&rsquo;t mean specifically asking anything at all. Don&rsquo;t use this as a way to avoid saying hard stuff—&lsquo;making space&rsquo; is not an easy way out but a specific tool to be used intentionally. I&rsquo;m saying that because usually if a question is important, it&rsquo;s important to say out loud. However, if you think that asking explicitly will make it too intimidating for him to answer truthfully, you can start by implicitly making space for what you suspect could be his tough answer.</p>
		<p>Because of traditional masculinity, boys often have a strong belief that they need to handle their feelings independently—and because so many boys and men do this, boys also often have the impression that they are the only ones feeling the way they&rsquo;re feeling. This is why making space is important. It demonstrates that &lsquo;unmasculine&rsquo; feelings are okay and worth talking about, and that the hard expectations of hegemonic masculinity are not your expectations and therefore not applicable to the space you share together.</p>
			<blockquote><p>I spend time with a boy whom I know is dealing with homophobic bullying, and I notice that he&rsquo;s saying a lot of transparently heterosexual and traditionally masculine things (e.g. how hot a female actor is or that a car is gay). I make space for alternative sexualities while we&rsquo;re together by subtly commenting on good-looking male actors and explicitly shutting down his homophobic comments, and the next day I message him: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to say all that heterosexual stuff with me.&rdquo; Later in the evening he tells me that he&rsquo;s never told anyone, but he thinks he might be gay.</blockquote>
	<h3 id="listening">Listening</h3>
		<p>Asking the question is hard. Understanding the answer is sometimes just as challenging. Because of society&rsquo;s boys-don&rsquo;t-cry rhetoric, a lot of boys are lack skills in both identifying and expressing their emotions. They know that. It feels wrong. It&rsquo;s hard, it&rsquo;s awkward. They think they shouldn&rsquo;t (or can&rsquo;t) answer, so often they&rsquo;ll do their best not to.</p>
		<p><em>Staying silent</em><br>
		A boy staying silent might seem like the worst, most uncomfortable thing, but at least he&rsquo;s not telling you to fuck off. It could definitely be worse. My first bit of advice is to get comfortable with silence. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with not saying words—you&rsquo;re saying a lot just by being there. Often we get uncomfortable with an &lsquo;awkward silence&rsquo; so we feel the need to fill it with unnecessary words. Ask yourself if you would be talking to make him feel better, or yourself feel better. If it&rsquo;s the latter, don&rsquo;t.</p>
		<p>If I need the conversation to move forward, I would start with simple yes-or-no questions, a guess at how he&rsquo;s feeling, a short story or a tour of the stickers on my waterbottle. Questions are best. Once he starts talking, it will be harder for him to stop.</p>
			<blockquote><p>A boy who I know is sad has his head down in a pillow. I ask him if he&rsquo;s okay, he doesn&rsquo;t respond. I ask him if he can talk, he doesn&rsquo;t respond. I whisper to him if he can breathe, he doesn&rsquo;t respond. I put my hand on his back and feel him take a breath, then tell him, &ldquo;Yep, you&rsquo;re breathing.&rdquo; I wait for a bit, and ask him if he wants his back rubbed or no. He says yes through the pillow. Then I sit with him, stay silent, and wait for him to talk.</p></blockquote>
		<p><em>Acting indifferent</em><br>
		The key word here is &lsquo;acting.&rsquo; A boy will often work very hard to convince you that something doesn&rsquo;t matter to him because if he can convince you, he can convince himself. What you need to keep in mind is that his supposed indifference is coming from an incorrect, inadequate notion of hegemonic masculinity that says to be a real man, he can&rsquo;t be hurt. Not meeting that ideal of invulnerability can be almost as painful as being hurt in the first place. With that in mind, your goal is not for him to break down and cry, but for him to acknowledge that he cares.</p>
		<p>With different nuances depending on the boy or the situation, I would meet indifference with simple observations and questions about his experience, and what he wants. Yes-or-no questions are fine. By getting him to think critically about how he feels and how he wants to feel, I can bring him on board with communicating that and working to change it.</p>
			<blockquote><p>A boy who is getting bullied tells me it doesn&rsquo;t matter when I bring up the subject of what to do about the bullies. He thinks there&rsquo;s nothing to be done and he should just be &lsquo;strong&rsquo; enough to get over it independently. I ask him if he wants them to stop and he says he doesn&rsquo;t care. I ask him if he likes it when they make fun of him, he says no. I ask him if it makes him feel good, he says no. &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; I tell him, &ldquo;You do care.&rdquo; He reluctantly agrees that it does matter, but says he doesn&rsquo;t know what to do.</p></blockquote>
		<p><em>Changing the subject</em><br>
		Changing the subject is one of the most-used ways of avoiding something you don&rsquo;t want to talk about. It&rsquo;s a get-out-of-jail(-free) card. As such, it&rsquo;s a tool, and sometimes you&rsquo;ve got to remember that he might really need that tool—he might be signalling, intentionally or not, that he&rsquo;s not ready to talk. The first step to handling a subject change is to notice it. Not always easy. Then you have to quickly decide if you&rsquo;re going to let him get away with it or not. From his words and his body language, you should be able to tell if he can handle the difficult conversation or not. If he can, I won&rsquo;t let him change the subject. If he can&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll follow him—but I&rsquo;ll often let him know that I noticed the subject change, just so he knows he&rsquo;s not fooling me.</p>
		<p>This gets tough if he tries to change the subject to something else you want to talk about. Then it becomes a question of priority. When a boy is letting you have glimpses of his complex inner life, whether on purpose or not, you have to bookmark the things you want to come back to. Decide which conversation is more important, and keep going.</p>
			<blockquote><p>I tell a boy who punched a wall that I&rsquo;m glad he punched a wall and not a person, and that level of self-control must not have been easy. He doesn&rsquo;t answer. I ask him if he can tell me what made him upset, and he tells me he thinks he might have broken his hand. I give him a few seconds of changed subject as well as an escape route, responding that he probably did actually break his hand and asking if it hurts a lot, to which he says it&rsquo;s okay. (He could have said it hurt too bad to talk—at which point I would have known that even if he <i>was</i> faking it hurting that bad, he would be doing so at the cost of his stoicism, which would mean both that he was really serious about not being ready to talk and that I could demonstrate that I care about him—but he doesn&rsquo;t use the way out.) So after a few seconds I bring the conversation back to what happened to upset him.</p></blockquote>
		<p><em>Half-answering</em><br>
		A half-answer is when he answers a question that&rsquo;s slightly different than the one you asked. This one is sometimes hard to notice, because it might seem at first like he&rsquo;s answered your question. To pick up on a half-answer, you really have to know what you were asking. Does his answer address it or avoid it? If he&rsquo;s avoiding it, do you know why? Depending on the context, I&rsquo;ve responded to a half-answer by playfully rephrasing the question, asking if it&rsquo;s hard to talk about (in order to talk about why it&rsquo;s hard) or gently telling him that&rsquo;s not what I asked.</p>
			<blockquote><p>I ask a young teenager whom I know is feeling sad if he wants to talk on the phone. He responds with: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ok. We don&rsquo;t have to.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a half-answer. I didn&rsquo;t ask if we <i>had</i> to, I asked if he <i>wanted</i> to. I point that out to him, and within a minute the phone rings.</p></blockquote>
			<blockquote><p>A teenager is telling me about his friend spending a lot of time with a new girlfriend. I ask him how that makes him feel. He says: &ldquo;Well, he seems pretty happy about it and it&rsquo;s good that he has a girlfriend.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a half-answer. I didn&rsquo;t ask about his friend, I asked about him. I ask again, emphasizing <i>you</i>. He tells me he feels lonely and let down.</blockquote>
