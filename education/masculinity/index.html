	<h1><div align="center">My Work in Masculinity</div></h1>
	<p>I&rsquo;ve been involved in education and youth mentoring for years. At some point I clued into the fact that the passion and skills that I have for working with boys in particular are not extremely common. A lot of people are really good. Of course. But being versed in theory-based critique of traditional masculinity and having a high-level ability to engage and connect with boys is I guess what I would think of as a bit of a niche.</p>
	<p>Feeling like I&rsquo;m tooting my own horn a little bit here but I don&rsquo;t want to underemphasize the fact that I&rsquo;m changing boys&rsquo; lives. I&rsquo;m passionate about this, and I&rsquo;m good at it too. So this is a ongoing collection of the work that I&rsquo;ve done. No real reason for it to exist, except I might want to have it someday.</p>

		An attempt to fill a void that so far it feels like only I have noticed. I&rsquo;ve had more parents than I can remember tell me they admire and value my skill in working with kids and particularly with boys, yet no one&rsquo;s ever asked me to create an accessible resource for working with boys through a lens of critical masculinity. I wish they would.

		<em>Tumblr &#8212; 2014-ongoing</em><br>
		Began as just a way for me to record quotes from books or articles that I wanted to remember, but as it gained popularity it became a way to share ideas and new ways of thinking with other people.
	</p>
	<h3 id="workshops">Workshops</h3>
	<p>These are workshops that I&rsquo;ve either organized or spoken at. Some of them both. 
		<ul>
			<li><em>&lsquo;The Mask You Live In&rsquo; Evening Activity (Camp Arowhon) &#8212; July 2016-August 2016</em><br>
				Developed and ran four sessions on masculinity and wearing &lsquo;masks&rsquo; to hide emotion and vulnerability with collectively around 150 boys aged 10-16. Debriefed with the staff to help them process their own experiences and how they could best help their campers with some of the things that had been revealed.</li>
			<li><em>Male Staff Homophobia/Masculinity Training Session (Camp Arowhon) &#8212; June 2016</em><br>
				Led a discussion on what is inside and outside the &lsquo;boy box&rsquo; and what kind of culture of masculinity we wanted to create—as the male staff and therefore important role models—for the boys at our summer camp.
			</li>
			<li><em>Masculinity Inservice (Norval Outdoor School) &#8212; March 2016</em><br>
				Wrote and delivered a workshop that centred on the impact of traditional masculinity on boys&rsquo; experiences with emotional literacy, sports and homophobia; using firsthand examples from Norval&rsquo;s outdoor education classes as bases for discussion.</li>
			<li><em>Masculinity and Outdoor Education Seminar (Queen&rsquo;s Outdoor and Experiential Education Program) &#8212; December 2015</em><br>
				Wrote and delivered two workshops that discussed the historical shaping of traditional masculinity in the context of 19th century boy-focused early outdoor education programs, presented new research on boys&rsquo; interactions with hegemonic masculinity, education and sport; and applied those theories to outdoor and experiential education today.</li>
			<li><em>Maskulinity Conference (Queen&rsquo;s University) &#8212; March 2015</em><br>
				Performed a slam poem called &lsquo;Be a Man.&rsquo;</li>
			<li><em>&lsquo;The Mask You Live In&rsquo; Film Screening (Concurrent Education Student Association with Queen&rsquo;s White Ribbon Campaign) &#8212; March 2015</em><br>
				Organized and spoke in a panel discussion in conjunction with a local premiere of a documentary focused on boys and masculinity in 21st-century America.</li>
		</ul>

	<h3 id="experience">Masculinity-Related Experience</h3>
	<p>A lot of the experience I have written down in my <a href="../resume">education resume</a> is completely relevant but I&rsquo;m not going to maintain two separate lists, so these are things that are just relevant to masculinity. AKA not included elsewhere.</p>
