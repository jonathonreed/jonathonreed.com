			<h3>My photo archive is littered with photos I call &lsquo;jotos,&rsquo; a word I made up in reference to my specific style of jump shot.</h3>
			<p>I&rsquo;ve taken &lsquo;the joto&rsquo; windswept on the edge of a cliff in Norway, ankle-deep in the Bali Sea in Indonesia, sunlit above the Grand Canyon in the United States. It&rsquo;s become a go-to shot when I find myself in a scenic landscape. Primarily for the fun of it. It&rsquo;s sort of like going down a slide when I was a kid: it doesn&rsquo;t really serve much of a purpose, it&rsquo;s just fun to do. In 2015 I did parkour training and came away with a heightened love for the practice of controlled risk. It involves preparation and progression, and definitely muscle, which has its own sense of fun. In the same sense of parkour, I like taking any opportunity to challenge other people&rsquo;s definition of what is safe. I think most people&mdash;kids especially&mdash;are too physically safe and it&rsquo;s good to push that boundary. Lastly, let&rsquo;s be honest, it&rsquo;s a glorified selfie. How do I take a picture of myself and make it not look self-centered? Make it look epic.</p>
			<p>One of my mottos is based on a quote that I saw beside an outdoor basketball court: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t stop playing because we grow older. We grow older because we stop playing.&rdquo; So that&rsquo;s the joto. Playing.</p>

			<h3>I encourage you to find your own unique thing. If you want to try the joto, though, here&rsquo;s how I get the shot.</h3>
			<p>If I&rsquo;m out with someone, odds are I&rsquo;ll rope them into being my photographer. Depending on their skill level with a DSLR it usually takes a few tries. I&rsquo;ve also set up my own shots with my camera on a tripod and either an intervalometer or an audio trigger run through <a href="http://www.magiclantern.fm/">Magic Lantern</a>.</p>
			<p>I usually go for a centered composition. This probably goes without saying but the photo is best captured at the peak of the jump. Takes a bit of practice but allows for the best composition and, most importantly, the best air. That&rsquo;s important because for me, the crucial element of the photo is my body clearing the horizon. I usually position the camera at a low angle with a wide-angle lens, making the most of perspective and lens distortion to make it look like I&rsquo;m jumping even higher than I am. Plus I can jump quite high. But the position and lens are definitely part of it.</p>
			<p>Those are the general practices. Center/peak, low/wide-angle. I break those rules if I feel like it will make for a better photo but generally that&rsquo;s what I go for.</p>
