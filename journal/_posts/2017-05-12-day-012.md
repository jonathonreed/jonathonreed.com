We bid farewell to our home with walls for the past several nights, our incredible host, our canine buddy, and the two felines who've been seeing all our charging cables as pieces of yarn. I leave with more than just another place to call home which includes a few neighbours, local and 'from away'. You keep finding excuses to return to places if you are lucky in life and I feel exceedingly lucky in regards to people, places, and so much more.

Jonathon said a few days ago by the side of the highway, "One of the big takeaways for me after this trip, I already know, will be a deeper appreciation for walls."

C'est vrais. This is true.

Jonathon sent out [Dispatch No. 2](http://mailchi.mp/3ca4fd3c5acf/as-the-raven-flies-dispatch-02) and we took our time rolling out the door, something I suspect we won't get too comfortable with as it gets warmer. If we are explorers-in-residence then our residence, for now, is the road and we best be operating from there. Still, as I write from our tent floor home and office just West of Grand Falls-Windsor, it is 9 pm and we've put a modest 81 km between where we started this morning and where we've stopped.

It was a chilly day and firing up the stove and giving myself a short steam bath while cooking dinner was very welcome. We missed the opportunity to talk to two conservation officers but chatted up some other locals ever-so-briefly.

There is much to write about on questions such as:
What do you think about when you bicycle for so many hours?
How many calories are you eating and what do the meals look/taste like? 
What are you reading? 
Is this trip self-indulgent?
What are the drivers like?
Have you seen any moose or caribou yet? What about other wildlife?

All good questions and the answers are coming soon.
