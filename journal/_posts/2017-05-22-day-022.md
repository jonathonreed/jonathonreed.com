Picture perfect day for being outdoors, we got up early to read and write, back-up files, try to catch up on the digital side of chores like sending out [Dispatch No. 3](http://mailchi.mp/d379c437fc24/as-the-raven-flies-dispatch-2437677), finishing [Elder Calvin White's tale](http://astheravenfli.es/journal/2017/05/21/calvin-white-mikmaq-elder/). Breakfast had two nutritious and delicious courses. Our stint in Nova Scotia feels very short so we've got a fair amount of coordination to do in regards to lining up interviews.

We were very fortunate to have incredible hosts (again and as usual) and s-l-o-w-l-y hit the road. Too slowly, Jon and I take a lead on who directs the day and today was mine. Still we biked as far as we wanted and needed to.

There were dogs named Biscuit and Spud, one of whom helped clean our dishes after a very determined and focused attempt at joining in on our quinoa, tofu, refried beans dinner. Won't mention which one.

We pulled into Port Hood to pick up some supplies and were very quickly invited to camp out on a field that used to be a swamp. Writing this with a roaring fire in front of us, better than colour television as our host tells us.
