He offered us a place in his backyard and beside the bonfire, then walked over to his shed to come back with some cans of beer. From there you could tell this was a guy who identified strongly with masculinity. He told drinking stories, made jokes about his gun collection and talked about working on oil rigs on the east coast.

At one point he was talking about his kids and he mentioned going to his daughter's upcoming dance recital.

"I'm not a ballet kind of father." He paused. "But I am a supportive kind of father."
