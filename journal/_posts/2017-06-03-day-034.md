The longest cycling day we've had on the tour so far with 144 kilometers from Tignish to where I'm writing this from in Port Elgin, New Brunswick. Another day, another province. Jonathon also sent out [Dispatch No. 4](http://mailchi.mp/d17b94ace565/as-the-raven-flies-dispatch-04?e=[UNIQID])!

We were up and at it and on the road. Perfect weather conditions. We've been very fortunate, I was telling my sister on the phone. As soon as I hung up, it started pouring rain and hail. It was sheer ridiculousness and very amusing to be having such weather in early June. I will remember Prince Edward Island for many things, especially these pop-up rain clouds.

There were moments of serendipity and with news of Ontario legislating a raise for the minimum wage it was good to be supporting small businesses and their neighbouring gardens.

I find myself thinking a lot about the imagery and metaphor behind certain spots. Maybe this is the nation we have. It is broken but it is ours and while knowledge and education is a first step, we still have to move forward from the point where we find ourselves in. I could spend more time trying to expand this into something more coherent but it'll have to wait.

Found some interesting facts about the ~13 km bridge connecting Prince Edward Island to the mainland, particularly around how it is currently managed by a conglomerate of companies and won't be handed over to the government till 2032. There was something sad about talking to someone who grew up with the ferry and literally saw some folks livelihood sink as the bridge rose. Progress (some would say)!

We let ourselves in to the home of our host and are lingering an extra day to work on the land. All of this, such a gift. An architectural feat. 

With cozy feet and a full tummy.
