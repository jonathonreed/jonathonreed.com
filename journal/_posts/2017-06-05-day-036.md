These past few days I've been very rigorous about being up early. If I wasn't cycling, I'd be fasting for Ramadan and waking up before the crack of dawn to eat. To honour that sentiment and to just get a headstart on these days in general, I've started setting my alarm earlier. Plus once summer arrives we'll want to be getting in some miles while it is cool. 

We had a large breakfast in two courses and I started up the woodstove, which is one of my favourite activities in the world and something I'm gaining proficiency in. 

We had a long day ahead of us with a possible interview in Moncton we were hoping to line up. So we didn't stop to chat for too long with a hitchhiker, I didn't ask a highway construction worker who saluted me if I could take his photo, but I did respond to the other crew member who asked, "You carrying your house with you?"

"Sure feels like it!"

Through the strangest alignment of the planets and stars with a heaping spoonful of serendipity, we ran into Mathieu Masse of Radio-Canada who set up an interview for us at their beautiful office space. We had a blast warming up the French component of our brains as we get ready to arrive in Québec et la Route Verte.

Thanks Paul and Frederique! You can read the piece [en Français ici](http://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/1038026/histoire-canada-velo-voyage-acadie).

A combination of irregular coffee drinking, sleeping late, waking up early, and what I suspect is an iron deficiency, I felt pretty puttered out by early afternoon. It isn't the most fun version of me and my thoughts drift down streams I'd rather them not be taking. Good training for long days and weeks and seasons ahead.

It was a tremdendous suprise and injection of energy when our peleton was expanded by two members, Kale and Sung, who are cycling from Halifax to Niagara and Vancouver respectively.

Jonathon and I were both drooling (still are a little) as to how lightly they're traveling. They on the other hand are laughing about how much we're carrying.

Brief spell of hanger and tiredness aside, a perfect albeit chilly day.
