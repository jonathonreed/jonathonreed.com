Going to keep this short because I'm going to try to finish a write-up of an interview from Lennox Island tonight and it's already 11 PM. Got up early and cycled to a gas station for a coffee and ice cream (Asad) and a not-fully-cooked microwaved sausage (me). Was quite chilly until the clouds cleared, just before we stopped for lunch.

We got to Fredericton around 4 PM and had the pleasure of spending the evening with four fascinating and uplifting locals. I think at some point we all ended up calling each other delightful. Asad took a lot of photos. Also did an interview with CBC Fredericton which will be aired tomorrow morning.

Wrote up a short piece about <a href="http://astheravenfli.es/journal/2017/06/06/pal-o-mine/">a chocolate bar</a>. On to the next.
