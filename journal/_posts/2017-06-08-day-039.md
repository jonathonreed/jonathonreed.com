Summer arrived with a vengeance. Today was the hottest weather I've experienced since the Utah desert last September. Hard to believe that two days ago I was wearing mittens. My focus switched immediately from staying warm to staying hydrated. We stopped three different times just to refill water bottles.

Asad stopped in an antique store, too.

When we reached Miramichi my handlebar grip was loose, and as I went to re-tighten it I lost the screw. Turns out it was a particular kind of screw that Canadian Tire doesn't sell. We ended up buying a pair of handlebar grips that didn't fit just in order to take the screws off them. 

"It works?" asked Sue in the Canadian Tire.

"Yeah," I replied with a bit of resignation. "Just an $18 screw, that's all."

She chuckled good-naturedly. "Ah. But it's shiny!" 

It made me laugh but didn't make me cheerful enough to feel like spending time photographing the screw rather than screwing it on and hitting the highway to make up for lost time. So no photo to go along with this story.

We camped on the other side of the moose fence beside Highway 11. I flew the drone from inside the safety of the tent. The blackflies were positively warlike. Wearing long sleeves and walking around in the sun left me sweaty and grimy and bloody, and so far the night is not cold enough.
