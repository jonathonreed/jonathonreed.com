Spent the day at our beautiful spot in Charlo watching the white-capped waves roll towards the east and working on a few pieces. I wrote about <a href="http://astheravenfli.es/journal/2017/06/10/ken-montgomery-engineer/">wind energy</a> and <a href="http://astheravenfli.es/journal/2017/06/10/the-relocation-of-black-point/">forced relocation</a> and I'm done writing about lobster fishing, just waiting to hear back on a couple things. Asad bicycled down the small highway towards Eel River Bar First Nation to get some groceries and took photos of an antique shop but I don't know more about that. 

Highlight was grilling the sandwiches for lunch. Melted cheese really hit the spot.
