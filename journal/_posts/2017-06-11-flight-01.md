The moment you've all been waiting for, the first episode of our podcast! 

<iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/327551454&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe>

A hodge podge of clips from the road, a cultural museum's retired-teacher-turned-fisherman captain, a former machinist talking about his love for Montreal Canadiens, an environmental historian about the rules for historical thinkering, a love story on the ferry, the tale of a lobster fisherman getting his boat, a young Mik'maq musician on Canada turning 150, a Syrian family talking about Canada and Canadian summers, Jonathon surviving an assassination attempt, and more. 

All in less than 8 minutes!

Incredible, I know, and we're only getting started. Enjoy and if you have any feedback please send it to ac@chairsandtables.org
