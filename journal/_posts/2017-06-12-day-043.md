Biked from the country's only bilingual province into the country's only French province. "When you get to the other side," said a local in Campbellton, "you're in Québec." I'm not sure about the geography of it but we were on the Route Verte today, and you could really tell. The old Appalachian mountains rose above the highway in the north, as green as trees could be.

At one point I passed another cycle tourist who was loaded up with panniers, headed west. We both raised a hand in greeting, and then he slowly twisted his hand into a thumbs up.

It sounds simple but it was really awesome.

This sculpture was on the coast of a town that I actually can't figure out right now. I took a scenic route and nearly biked past these bird men, then couldn't help going back to find out more.
