Hung around for a bit in the morning because we had a live interview on SiriusXM radio, then headed out into the sunshine with an expectedly brief stop at a bike shop to replace a couple spokes. Turns out we needed a bigger repair after our bikes had withstood both the Chic-Choc Mountains in the Gaspé Peninsula and Laurentians on the north coast of the St. Lawrence.

The biking infrastructure in Québec is really quite remarkable, and the size of <a href="https://lessardbicycles.com" target="blank">Lessard Bicycles</a> was a testament to the city's biking culture. They used to have three locations downtown, then six years ago decided to move uptown in order to have more space. Simply put it's the biggest bicycle shop I've ever seen.

So we headed back home and spent the afternoon eating well and working away on some overdue audio and articles. Next post on <a href="http://iso.500px.com" target="blank">500px</a> and next <a href="http://astheravenfli.es/follow/" target="blank">email dispatch</a> coming soon.
