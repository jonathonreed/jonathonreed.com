Spent the day working on pieces about <a href="http://astheravenfli.es/journal/2017/07/10/shaylynn-anishinaabekwe/">Shaylynn</a> from Beausoleil First Nation and <a href="http://astheravenfli.es/journal/2017/07/11/ruth-president/" target="blank">Ruth</a> from Arviat on the coast of Hudson Bay, as well as editing and uploading photos for future writing. In the evening we joined our wonderful host family on a boat to eat dinner on the still waters near Squirrel Island. Alec and I went swimming. The water was 17 ºC. 

I jumped out nearly as quickly as I had jumped in. "Man!" I shouted, "What right does a little river have to be so cold in July?"

Bev laughed. "Well it's coming from Lake Superior."

That'll teach me to not know my geography.
