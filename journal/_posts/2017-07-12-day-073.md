More writing today. The rain poured down all morning and I thought to myself that one of these rainy days I really ought to find myself a hot chocolate. Among the other things I really ought to do. I finished my book from Wikwemikong First Nation and Asad dropped it off in the mail along with my old weather-defeated camera body. 

Rode down to the bike shop Vélorution where we camped out for the night. Met some other cyclists and travellers, plus our friend Sergei whom we first met cycling into Sudbury. I spent the evening listening to the rain on the tent (cosy), messaging my mom on Snapchat (good parenting) and writing a journal entry/letter to my twin (emotional).
