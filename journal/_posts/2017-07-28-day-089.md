Spent most of the morning working on some overdue written and audio pieces, most notably <a href="http://astheravenfli.es/journal/2017/07/28/energy-east/" target="blank">Energy East</a> from North Bay, an interview that I've been working on for a while. Drank lots of water today.

In the afternoon we went to the provincial archives and while we missed the public hours (and therefore couldn't access the documents themselves) we got a tour of the conservation lab and Hudson's Bay Company archives. Which is how I discovered that the very first meeting recorded in the very first logbook of the Hudson's Bay Company took place on my birthday, October 24. 323 years before I was born.

Archives make history tangible in a really impactful way, so I got back to our home in Winnipeg invigorated to push through my journalism work. Calling it a night at almost 1 AM.
