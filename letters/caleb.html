	<p>Dear Caleb,</p>
	<p>You tried to kill yourself last week. Really tried. In between blood transfusions at the hospital you wrote me a letter, and I promised I would write back.</p>
	<p>You&rsquo;ve got the odds stacked against you. Understatement. Like it&rsquo;s not hard enough being 13 years old, or being trans, or being a child abuse survivor, or having depression, or being a foster kid; you&rsquo;ve got it all at once. What the fuck. Who signed on to that lottery ticket. It&rsquo;s not fair. Nowhere near.</p>
	<p>So shit is hard. And that&rsquo;s real.</p>
	<p>I wish you never, ever felt rejected. I wish you were never lonely. It makes me sad that your birth parents didn&rsquo;t see how good you are. It makes me mad that some of your foster parents don&rsquo;t understand the consequences of abuse or PTSD. You don&rsquo;t deserve that.</p>
	<p>You deserve the very best.</p>
	<p>I bet you just read that and didn&rsquo;t believe it. I wish you did. Here is what I believe. As a child, you are sacred. Non-negotiable. As an abuse victim, your ability to feel and trust that sacredness was taken away from you. And when you can&rsquo;t access that sacredness, the best you&rsquo;ve got is instinct.</p>
	<p>But I think your instincts let you down. You instinctively believe that you are not worth talking to. Not worth singing to. You instinctively blame yourself and are quick to hear blame in the voices of others. You run. You hurt yourself. You stay silent. I think you have a lot of shame inside you that you can&rsquo;t talk about, and more pain than any 13 year old should ever know.</p>
	<p>I think you shield yourself the best you can. But a 13-year-old boy has never made a good shield, let alone a boy with odds like yours.</p>
	<p>To survive anything, you need supporters. That&rsquo;s why they send young men into war in battalions and platoons. They know those boys are safer with other people covering their backs. Despite what you probably think, you&rsquo;re doing a good job of finding those people. Between me, Yoki, Chase, Sherri, Karen, Linda, Steve, PFLAG, TrevorSpace, Tumblr; your group is a lot bigger than it was when I met you in December.</p>
	<p>I think you know, though, that you can have all these people in your corner but they don&rsquo;t matter that much if you&rsquo;re not there with them.</p>
	<p>I ask you to do hard things all the time. I know they&rsquo;re hard but I believe they&rsquo;re right. So here is one more: Join them. (Oh look, I quoted Justin Bieber.) You have a lot of people that love you and admire you and think you are worth so much. You really do. The hard part is, you have to try to believe them.</p>
	<p>It&rsquo;s called self-compassion and, sun boy, you need it just as much as you need me.</p>
	<p>I love you. I think of you when I see freckles, when I see dragonflies. The smell of coffee makes me think of you. The feel of the morning sun. The sound of my guitar. Because of you I have grown in so many ways. I&rsquo;ve become more patient, more compassionate, I&rsquo;ve learned about foster care and transgender health care, I&rsquo;ve learned more guitar songs than I&rsquo;ve ever known. Because of you I&rsquo;m thinking about starting a summer camp for trans and gender-non-conforming kids. I am better because of you.</p>
	<p>I am lucky to know you and have you in my life, and I love you.</p>
	<p>I will never want to stop talking to you and even though reality will continue to pull its old tricks and I will continue to make mistakes and even if you ask me to, I am not going to leave you. I hope you keep trying to get better and keep believing that you can.</p>
	<p>You can beat the odds.</p>

<div class="letter">
	<p>Caleb Lucas Carter,</p>
	<p>This was the first name I thought of and one of the names I thought of giving my son some day. I&rsquo;m giving it to you. Most of us walk in the light and the shadow, and some more shadow than others. But there are a chosen few who walk this world, carrying their own light to brighten both day and night. You are that light, and I don&rsquo;t think you know it quite yet. So I&rsquo;m giving you this name in the belief that you will live long enough to see yourself for the light you are. You shine, Caleb Lucas. And you will keep shining.</p>
	<p>I hope it will keep you company on dark sidewalks at night. I hope it will give you strength in the darkest hours before dawn. I hope it will remind you of the light I will always, always give back to you.</p>
	<p>May it be a light to you in dark places, when all other lights go out.</p>
	<p>Jonathon<br>
