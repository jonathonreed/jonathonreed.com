		<h1>Slam poetry</h1>
		<h2>What this is</h2>
			<p>This is nothing special. I'm absolutely not an expert in slam poetry. I don't have much experience competing and most of my poems are unfinished and unperformed. But(!) slam poetry isn't about your cred anyway. Slamming is just about what you've got on your chest and how well you can spit.</p>
			<p>So maybe reading nothing special is a good way to start.</p>
			<p>In particular, this is for Itzcuauhtli (yes, I designed and wrote this entire thing just for you), who wants to be a slam poet and asked me to perform one of my poems twice in a row. So for him and anyone else who wants to slam, here's what I've got.</p>
		<h2>What shapes my poetry</h2>
			<p><b>Authenticity.</b> Everything I slam is true. My poems are always about real people and real things. The idea of having a fictional poem makes me uncomfortable. It's just not what slam poetry is about.</p>
				<blockquote>You know natural disasters aren't so far<br>
				The Manitoba Fires burned 2.5 million hectares in 1989<br>
				One of my friends from high school died by suicide last year<br>
				What are you calling natural?<br>
				How many deaths will it take?</blockquote>
			<p><b>Performance.</b> It's not just poetry, right, it's meant to be performed. So I always have body language associated with my words or interactions with the audience.</p>
				<blockquote>And you, the audience, really you this time:<br>
					I didn't say it to them so I'm slamming it to you</blockquote>
		<h2>What determines my language</h2>
			<p><b>Alliteration.</b> I like to place words that start with the same letter together because of the way it lets sentences easily roll off my tongue. I use it to keep my lines tight and fitting together nicely.</p>
				<blockquote>So here I am spilling some secrets into a microphone;<br>
				Saying them now because someone told me<br>
				That somehow late is better than never<br>
				So I'm sorry</blockquote>
			<p><b>Rhyme.</b> I rhyme kind of by accident. I used to hate rhyming poetry, because I felt that it constricted my word choice. So now when I do rhyme, I don't let it get in the way of what I want to say, you know? But it's easier than I thought it was and I've found that carefully choosing words that rhyme so that sentences balance can have a really cool effect.</p>
				<blockquote>I knocked him down<br>
				He hit the ground and he didn't make a sound<br>
				Until I heard a teacher say, "Are you okay?"<br>
				And he whispered, "I want Jonathon."</blockquote>
			<p><b>Rhythm.</b> The piece has got to flow, and I can't think of a better way to explain it. Syntax, syllables, that kind of thing. For tempo, I like to juxtapose speaking fast/hard and slow/soft. Practicing a lot lets me be able to speak some parts really fast, which then makes the slow parts stand out even more. Feeling the rhythm of the piece helps make sure the fast parts are still understandable.</p>
				<blockquote>[fast] Don't cry, toughen up, be a man<br>
				What are you some kind of faggot, you faggot<br>
				You mama's boy, what are you gonna go home and cry about it<br>
				Come on walk it off, rub some dirt in it, be a good soldier<br>
				[slow] Be a good soldier</blockquote>
			<p><b>Imagery.</b> I'm not sure if this is worth including, but I try to be really intentional about the descriptive language I use. Metaphors can be awesome awesome awesome for conveying an idea really vividly. Sometimes I bring up the same metaphor to slam the message home.</p>
				<blockquote>And you know what that felt like?<br>
				It felt like an ocean wave slamming against me<br>
				An entire tide of salt water rising behind my eyes<br>
				[...]<br>
				I want you to imagine<br>
				That you have a chance to reach out and grab my friend's fist<br>
				Right before that ocean wave hit</blockquote>
			<p>As far as I go with metaphors, though, I also want to make sure that what I'm describing is really clear. So sometimes I just lay it out really excplicitly.
				<blockquote>To the boy who tried smoking because it made his mom mad and he's gonna die anyway<br>
				Who counts his ribs and joints and tries hard to believe in that thing that his pastor calls hope<br>
				Who locks his fingers together like puzzle piece prayers as he falls asleep:<br>
				I wish I could take your cancer and hold it deep inside me</blockquote>
		<h2>What inspires me</h2>
			<p>Some of my favourite slam poets that are kind of famous online are Shane Koyczan, Sarah Kay, Andrea Gibson and Lacey Roop. I've also jammed with some other talented artists like Luke Nephew and Ritalin.</p>
			<p>I have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB6494B99059A6697" target="blank">playlist on YouTube</a> of my favourite slam poems. I think it was the default slam poetry playlist or something because it has 60,000+ views. Anyways. It goes without saying but they're all incredible. I suggest watching them and then hitting up the recommended videos in the sidebar.</p>

		<h2>What I want you to keep in mind most of all</h2>
			<p>Slam poetry is whatever the hell you want it to be. I just wrote a bunch of stuff that I made up, right. There are no rules, and if there were, I'd tell you to break them. I was thinking this could be helpful for you to get started and to build confidence.</p>
			<p>Have fun. Be real. Looking forward to spitting with you.</p>
