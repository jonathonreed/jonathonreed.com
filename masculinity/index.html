<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
	
<div class="masculinity-intro">
	
	<h1 class="size4em heavy uppercase alignleft letterspacing01em">Masculinity</h1>
	<p>I have a degree in outdoor education and years of experience working with young people. I&rsquo;ve worked as a head counsellor at a summer camp, taught in schools, volunteered in at-risk youth mentoring programs and coordinated a festival&rsquo;s youth program. I&rsquo;ve facilitated slam poetry workshops. I&rsquo;ve intervened in suicide attempts. You get it.</p>
	<p>Throughout my professional experience I&rsquo;ve studied gender and masculinity, and I&rsquo;ve seen firsthand the consequences of hegemonic masculinity. Things like isolation, bravado, violence and misogyny. Because of this, I believe that raising boys in ways that are more connected and nurturing is a critical step towards improving the mental health of boys and men, as well as ending violence against women. This doesn&rsquo;t mean undermining boys&rsquo; masculine identities. It means expanding their definitions of manhood.</p>
	<p>As a young man who is skilled at building strong, authentic relationships with boys, and versed in gender theory related to masculinities, I believe that I have a valuable role to play in the movement for gender justice. Not a unique one, of course. But a valuable one.</p>

	<h2 class="heavy uppercase">Breaking the Boy Code Podcast</h2>
	<p>The premise of this podcast is that boys have inner lives&mdash;personal, emotional experiences that are often hidden from view&mdash;and that if adults are going to play an effective role in boys&rsquo; lives, they need to better understand those experiences and how they are expressed. I&rsquo;m currently producing the first season of the podcast: five episodes, each centred on a different boy&rsquo;s experience and interwoven with the perspectives of experts and leaders in progressive masculinity.</p>
	<p>The podcast originated as a Tumblr blog in which I recorded quotes and multimedia related to masculinity and boyhood. That project is ongoing and is as useful for me as an archive as it is for other people to follow.</p>

	<h2 class="heavy uppercase">Speaking and Workshops</h2>
	<p>In various places I&rsquo;ve been asked to share my knowledge and skills with fellow educators, summer camp staff as well as with boys themselves. My availability depends on other freelancing- and adventure-based work I&rsquo;m pursuing, but offering leadership in training peers and young people is something that is very important to me. Some recent examples are below. Contact me if you&rsquo;re interested in discussing further.</p>
	<p>&lsquo;The Mask You Live In&rsquo; Evening Activity<br>
	Developed and ran four evening sessions at a summer camp on what&rsquo;s &lsquo;allowed&rsquo; and &lsquo;not allowed&rsquo; for boys, and how we wear &lsquo;masks&rsquo; to hide emotions and appear invulnerable. Used part of Jennifer Newson&rsquo;s <a href="" target="blank">The Mask You Live In</a> as a base. Collectively worked with about 150 boys ages 10-16, and debriefed with the counsellors to help them process their own experiences and how they could best help their campers with some of the things that had been revealed.</p>
	<p>Male Staff Homophobia/Masculinity Training Session<br>
	Led a discussion on what is inside and outside the &lsquo;boy box&rsquo; and what kind of culture of masculinity we wanted to create—as the male staff and therefore important role models—for the boys at a summer camp.</p>
	<p>&lsquo;Masculinity at School&rsquo; Inservice<br>
	Wrote and delivered a staff inservice at an outdoor school that centred on the impact of traditional masculinity on boys&rsquo; experiences with education, emotional literacy, sports and homophobia; using firsthand examples from their recent class groups as bases for discussion.</p>
	<p>&lsquo;Masculinity and Outdoor Education&rsquo; Seminar<br>
	Wrote and delivered two workshops that discussed the historical shaping of traditional masculinity in the context of 19th century boy-focused early outdoor education programs, presented new research on boys&rsquo; interactions with hegemonic masculinity, education and sport; and applied those theories to outdoor and experiential education today.</p>

	<h2 class="heavy uppercase">Writing</h2>
	<p>My writing about masculinity has been featured on Medium, The Good Men Project and Ravishly. Subjects have included boyhood masculinity, homophobia, transgender youth, feminism and gender justice. I&rsquo;m currently working on setting up a Medium publication to support youth workers writing about similar subjects, but that&rsquo;s a work in progress.</p>
