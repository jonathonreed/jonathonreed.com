	<p>I have a degree in outdoor education and years of experience working with young people. I&rsquo;ve worked as a head counsellor at a summer camp, taught in schools, volunteered in at-risk youth mentoring programs and coordinated a festival&rsquo;s youth program. I&rsquo;ve facilitated slam poetry workshops. I&rsquo;ve intervened in suicide attempts. You get it.</p>
	<p>Throughout my professional experience I&rsquo;ve studied gender and masculinity, and I&rsquo;ve seen firsthand the consequences of hegemonic masculinity. Things like isolation, bravado, violence and misogyny. Because of this, I believe that raising boys in ways that are more connected and nurturing is a critical step towards improving the mental health of boys and men, as well as ending violence against women. This doesn&rsquo;t mean undermining boys&rsquo; masculine identities. It means expanding their definitions of manhood.</p>
	<p>As a young man who is skilled at building strong, authentic relationships with boys, and versed in gender theory related to masculinities, I believe that I have a valuable role to play in the movement for gender justice. Not a unique one, of course. But a valuable one.</p>

	<h2 class="padding-top-1rem heavy uppercase">Breaking the Boy Code Podcast</h2>
	<p>The premise of <a href="http://breakingtheboycode.com" target="blank">Breaking the Boy Code</a> is that boys have inner lives&mdash;personal, emotional experiences that are often hidden from view&mdash;and that if adults are going to play an effective role in boys&rsquo; lives, they need to better understand those experiences and how they are expressed. I&rsquo;m currently producing the first season of the podcast: five episodes, each centred on a different boy&rsquo;s experience and interwoven with the perspectives of experts and leaders in progressive masculinity.</p>
	<p>The podcast originated as a Tumblr blog in which I recorded quotes and multimedia related to masculinity and boyhood. That project is ongoing and is as useful for me as an archive as it is for other people to follow.</p>

	<h2 class="heavy uppercase">Speaking and Workshops</h2>
	<p>In various places I&rsquo;ve been asked to share my knowledge and skills with fellow educators, summer camp staff as well as with boys themselves. My availability depends on other freelancing- and adventure-based work I&rsquo;m pursuing, but offering leadership in training peers and young people is something that is definitely important to me.</p>
	<p>I&rsquo;ve run inservice trainings discussing masculinity within outdoor education, focusing mainly on the impact of traditional masculinity on boys&rsquo; experiences with education, emotional literacy, sports and homophobia. As part of my role as head counsellor I&rsquo;ve facilitated staff training sessions on masculinity culture at summer camp, as well as activities for boys ages 10-16, discussing the &lsquo;mask&rsquo; of masculinity and the importance of emotional connection.</p>
	<p>These are just a couple examples. I&rsquo;m flexible. Visit <a href="../speaking/">jonathonreed.com/speaking</a> or contact me if you&rsquo;re interested in discussing further.</p>

	<h2 class="heavy uppercase">Writing</h2>
	<p class="final">My writing about masculinity has been featured on Medium, The Good Men Project and Ravishly. Subjects have included boyhood masculinity, homophobia, transgender youth, feminism and gender justice. I write on a <a href="https://medium.com/breaking-the-boy-code" target="_blank">Medium publication</a> as part of the Breaking the Boy Code project.</p>
