	<p>I&rsquo;m currently <a href="http://nextgenmen.ca" target="_blank">Next Gen Men</a>&rsquo;s Program Coordinator, organizing and facilitating after-school boys programs about healthy masculinities and gender equity; and Head Counsellor at <a href="http://camparowhon.com/" target="_blank">Camp Arowhon</a>, where I lead a program on positive masculinity.</p>
	<p>Behind both of these roles are years of experience with boys. I&rsquo;ve built my skills in school classrooms, youth mentoring programs and Algonquin canoe trips. I&rsquo;ve let boys cry on my shoulder. I&rsquo;ve intervened in suicide attempts. You get the idea.</p>
	<p>Throughout my professional experience I&rsquo;ve studied gender and masculinity, and in various parts of my life I&rsquo;ve seen the consequences of quote-unquote toxic masculinity. I believe that young men like me play a unique role in expanding boys&rsquo; definitions of manhood. If we allow boys to be more connected and authentic, we can take a critical step towards improving the mental health of boys and men, as well as ending violence against women.</p>
	<p>Welcome to my life&rsquo;s mission.</p>

	<h2 class="padding-top-1rem heavy uppercase">Breaking the Boy Code Podcast</h2>
	<p>The premise of <a href="http://breakingtheboycode.com" target="blank">Breaking the Boy Code</a> is that boys have inner lives&mdash;personal, emotional experiences that are often hidden from view&mdash;and that if adults are going to play an effective role in boys&rsquo; lives, they need to better understand those experiences and how they are expressed. I&rsquo;m currently producing the first season of the podcast: five episodes, each centred on a different boy&rsquo;s experience and interwoven with the perspectives of experts and leaders in progressive masculinity.</p>
	<p>The podcast originated as a Tumblr blog in which I recorded quotes and multimedia related to masculinity and boyhood. That project is ongoing and is as useful for me as an archive as it is for other people to follow.</p>

	<h2 class="heavy uppercase">Speaking and Workshops</h2>
	<p>In various places I&rsquo;ve been asked to share my knowledge and skills with fellow educators, summer camp staff as well as with boys themselves. My availability depends on other freelancing- and adventure-based work I&rsquo;m pursuing, but offering leadership in training peers and young people is something that is definitely important to me.</p>
	<p>I&rsquo;ve run inservice trainings discussing masculinity within outdoor education, focusing mainly on the impact of traditional masculinity on boys&rsquo; experiences with education, emotional literacy, sports and homophobia. As part of my role as head counsellor I&rsquo;ve facilitated staff training sessions on masculinity culture at summer camp, as well as activities for boys ages 10-16, discussing the &lsquo;mask&rsquo; of masculinity and the importance of emotional connection.</p>
	<p>These are just a couple examples. I&rsquo;m flexible. Contact me if you&rsquo;re interested in discussing further.</p>

	<h2 class="heavy uppercase">Writing</h2>
	<p class="final">My writing about masculinity has been featured on Medium, The Good Men Project and Ravishly. Subjects have included boyhood masculinity, homophobia, transgender youth, feminism and gender justice. I write on a <a href="https://medium.com/breaking-the-boy-code" target="_blank">Medium publication</a> as part of the Breaking the Boy Code project.</p>
