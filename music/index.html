	<h1>Something worth listening to</h1>
	<p>Music is one of those things that's comfortably and irrevocably part of my life. Like longboarding or eyeliner&mdash;it doesn't define me, but it's always kind of there. It beats in my chest and vibrates under my fingertips.</p>
	<p>I play music, sure. I also listen, sometimes really carefully. I was always the first of my siblings to ask my mom to put on a tape when we got in the van when I was little. I spent my savings as a kid on a guitar and an MP3 player. I always stop to listen to street musicians.</p>
	<p>So this is a big part of who I am. Over the past couple years I've been working on creating ways of sharing it with other people. I've currently got a <a href="http://staging.jonathonreed.com/music/seasons">mini-project for the seasons</a> and an indie folk music discovery archive called <a href="http://vinylandwind.tumblr.com">Vinyl & Wind</a>.</p>
	<p>"It may have been quixotic, but it was magnificent."<br>
