	<p>Dear Luke,</p>
	<p>You&rsquo;re a week or two away from moving in with Steve and Lynn. You probably still haven&rsquo;t let yourself quite believe that it&rsquo;s actually happening. You&rsquo;re terrified that you&rsquo;re going to screw this up.</p>
	<p>This is a big chance. It&rsquo;s not the only chance you&rsquo;ll ever have, but it&rsquo;s big. Which means it feels like a big risk. You&rsquo;re taking that risk and I&rsquo;m really proud of you for that.</p>
	<p>You want to be different and I&rsquo;m proud of you for that, too.</p>
	<p>But if we&rsquo;re talking about taking chances and being different, that means we&rsquo;re talking about stuff that a lot of the time you don&rsquo;t think you can do. You can, but you convince yourself that you can&rsquo;t. Start believing you can. Start right now.</p>
	<p>Let me put it like this. If there was ever, ever a time in your entire life to really, really try to do things differently, that time is now. Everything you&rsquo;ve ever struggled with is what could hold you back from making this tiny, hidden dream a reality. You need to ask for help. You need to talk about hard stuff. You need to trust Steven and Lynn.</p>
	<p>It&rsquo;s not going to be easy. We both know that. You don&rsquo;t know what will happen, and that&rsquo;s scary. We both know that, too.</p>
	<p>But if you refuse to talk about your depression? If you resort to the coping mechanisms you&rsquo;re used to and start cutting or running away? You do know what will happen then, because it&rsquo;s happened before. I know that&rsquo;s not what you want, and I know you know that too.</p>
	<p>So try. Try and try again, and never stop. Try even when you&rsquo;re exhausted. Try even when you think you can&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ll be with you every step of the way, and so will Aiden and so will Steven and Lynn.</p>
	<p>This is a big chance for life to change in ways you never thought it could. I don&rsquo;t know what will happen with Steven and Lynn, but I do know that they will help you change. And if you change, so will your life.</p>
	<p>I have hope.</p>

	<p>Dear Luke,</p>
	<p>Last night, Jackie told you that you couldn&rsquo;t stay with her. You believe(d) she gave up on you.</p>
	<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I can ever convince you of this, but here&rsquo;s how it was. Jackie wanted you, and she wanted to help you. She could have left you at the hospital when shit got hard, but she didn&rsquo;t. She kept you and she kept trying to connect with you. She wanted you to open up.</p>
	<p>You didn&rsquo;t. You stayed silent. You cried and told yourself she didn&rsquo;t give a shit and no one ever did anyway. You cut yourself. You threatened her.</p>
	<p>You pushed her away like you push me away. You push because you&rsquo;d rather that than risk the hurt of trying and being let down.</p>
	<p>I&rsquo;m not saying this to blame you, although I know it sounds like I am. I&rsquo;m saying this to explain what happened and to remind you why you want to be different. You&rsquo;re not unloveable. You are absolutely not unloveable. You just don&rsquo;t let yourself be loved.</p>
	<p>You want to be loved? Be loved.</p>
	<p>You want to be different? Start with a goal.</p>
	<p>This is your goal:</p>
	<blockquote><p>I, Luke, am going to ask Jonathon, Manon, my foster parents and my therapist for help with things that I struggle with; like having nightmares, cutting, dealing with suicidal thoughts and wanting to run away. I will ask for help when I need it, especially at night and when bad shit happens, like people being douchebags or making me do stuff I don&rsquo;t want to do. I will ask for help at least once a week. I will not ask for help without saying the hard stuff and pretend that&rsquo;s good enough. It&rsquo;s not.</p>
	<p>This will not be easy. Changing is not easy. But it&rsquo;s what I want to do.</p>
	<p>I will do it.</p></blockquote>
	<p>I will help you keep to it, but it is not my goal. It&rsquo;s yours. Becoming who you want to be is up to you.</p>
	<p>I love you.</p>

	<p>Dear Luke,</p>
	<p>This is not bullshit.</p>
	<p>If you&rsquo;re reading this, you probably think it is. Think back to every single time you trusted me&mdash;in the desert, on the coast, in the courtroom, in the hospital&mdash;and listen to me when I say this is not bullshit.</p>
	<p>You matter.</p>
	<p>I know that sometimes that is impossible for you to believe. Most times. And I know that&rsquo;s not a choice for you. If you could believe it, you would. If you could feel hopeful or trusting or good, you would.</p>
	<p>And sometimes you do. But a lot of times, your good feelings are too small. At best they&rsquo;re 4'8'', and the hate you face is huge. It&rsquo;s particularly huge because it comes from two places at once, from the outside world and from inside yourself. There&rsquo;s a lot of fucked-up people who have hate they can&rsquo;t put anywhere, so they dump it on you. And because that&rsquo;s happened for years, you&rsquo;ve got sadness that turns into hate as well. For yourself. It&rsquo;s internalized transphobia, just like the boy JJ that I told you about.</p>
	<p>I think I&rsquo;m getting confusing.</p>
	<p>Do you know a big reason Germany lost World War I? Because they were fighting a war on two fronts. They were fighting a war in two places at once, and that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re doing. You&rsquo;re fighting on the outside and on the inside.</p>
	<p>I want you to be strong on the inside, so you don&rsquo;t doubt yourself. So you don&rsquo;t have to have that fight. But being strong does not mean being independent. I want you to be strong enough to ask for help.</p>
	<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m telling you now: This is not bullshit. You matter.</p>
	<p>There are people that believe that about you. There is me and Sarah, Manon, Adrienne, Leanne, Alex, Jennifer, Aiden, Hunt, Sherri, Karen, Skyler. When you find too much hate around you and you start to close off, don&rsquo;t close off from us. When you start to doubt yourself, throw your last line of trust to us, and we&rsquo;ll hold on. We love you and we believe that you are worth loving.</p>
	<p>Again, not bullshit.</p>
	<p>The hard part is asking. I know it&rsquo;s hard, but just because it&rsquo;s hard doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s not right. Fight every instinct you have and ask for help. Even when you think you&rsquo;re worthless. Especially when you think you&rsquo;re worthless. Even when you don&rsquo;t want to talk about it. Especially then.</p>
	<p>And if you forget, read this again.</p>
	<p>I love you.</p>

<div class="letter">
	<p>Dear Caleb,</p>
	<p>You tried to kill yourself last week. Really tried. In between blood transfusions at the hospital you wrote me a letter, and I promised I would write back.</p>
	<p>You&rsquo;ve got the odds stacked against you. Understatement. Like it&rsquo;s not hard enough being 13 years old, or being trans, or being a child abuse survivor, or having depression, or being a foster kid; you&rsquo;ve got it all at once. What the fuck. Who signed on to that lottery ticket. It&rsquo;s not fair. Nowhere near.</p>
	<p>So shit is hard. And that&rsquo;s real.</p>
	<p>I wish you never, ever felt rejected. I wish you were never lonely. It makes me sad that your birth parents didn&rsquo;t see how good you are. It makes me mad that some of your foster parents don&rsquo;t understand the consequences of abuse or PTSD. You don&rsquo;t deserve that.</p>
	<p>You deserve the very best.</p>
	<p>I bet you just read that and didn&rsquo;t believe it. I wish you did. Here is what I believe. As a child, you are sacred. Non-negotiable. As an abuse victim, your ability to feel and trust that sacredness was taken away from you. And when you can&rsquo;t access that sacredness, the best you&rsquo;ve got is instinct.</p>
	<p>But I think your instincts let you down. You instinctively believe that you are not worth talking to. Not worth singing to. You instinctively blame yourself and are quick to hear blame in the voices of others. You run. You hurt yourself. You stay silent. I think you have a lot of shame inside you that you can&rsquo;t talk about, and more pain than any 13 year old should ever know.</p>
	<p>I think you shield yourself the best you can. But a 13-year-old boy has never made a good shield, let alone a boy with odds like yours.</p>
	<p>To survive anything, you need supporters. That&rsquo;s why they send young men into war in battalions and platoons. They know those boys are safer with other people covering their backs. Despite what you probably think, you&rsquo;re doing a good job of finding those people. Between me, Yoki, Chase, Sherri, Karen, Linda, Steve, PFLAG, TrevorSpace, Tumblr; your group is a lot bigger than it was when I met you in December.</p>
	<p>I think you know, though, that you can have all these people in your corner but they don&rsquo;t matter that much if you&rsquo;re not there with them.</p>
	<p>I ask you to do hard things all the time. I know they&rsquo;re hard but I believe they&rsquo;re right. So here is one more: Join them. (Oh look, I quoted Justin Bieber.) You have a lot of people that love you and admire you and think you are worth so much. You really do. The hard part is, you have to try to believe them.</p>
	<p>It&rsquo;s called self-compassion and, sun boy, you need it just as much as you need me.</p>
	<p>I love you. I think of you when I see freckles, when I see dragonflies. The smell of coffee makes me think of you. The feel of the morning sun. The sound of my guitar. Because of you I have grown in so many ways. I&rsquo;ve become more patient, more compassionate, I&rsquo;ve learned about foster care and transgender health care, I&rsquo;ve learned more guitar songs than I&rsquo;ve ever known. Because of you I&rsquo;m thinking about starting a summer camp for trans and gender-non-conforming kids. I am better because of you.</p>
	<p>I am lucky to know you and have you in my life, and I love you.</p>
	<p>I will never want to stop talking to you and even though reality will continue to pull its old tricks and I will continue to make mistakes and even if you ask me to, I am not going to leave you. I hope you keep trying to get better and keep believing that you can.</p>
	<p>You can beat the odds.</p>

	<p>Caleb Lucas Carter,</p>
	<p>This was the first name I thought of and one of the names I thought of giving my son some day. I&rsquo;m giving it to you. Most of us walk in the light and the shadow, and some more shadow than others. But there are a chosen few who walk this world, carrying their own light to brighten both day and night. You are that light, and I don&rsquo;t think you know it quite yet. So I&rsquo;m giving you this name in the belief that you will live long enough to see yourself for the light you are. You shine, Caleb Lucas. And you will keep shining.</p>
	<p>I hope it will keep you company on dark sidewalks at night. I hope it will give you strength in the darkest hours before dawn. I hope it will remind you of the light I will always, always give back to you.</p>
	<p>May it be a light to you in dark places, when all other lights go out.</p>
