<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hello, I&rsquo;m Barb, and I was given a life that allows me to cross borders. As a child I wanted to see from every perspective, so I read books. I&rsquo;ve met thousands of people in my travels, all who shared stories with me and opened my world further. Since moving to Kingston in 2000 I've been a baker, a bike mechanic, a water professional, a farmer and an artist. I&rsquo;ve helped run storefronts, organized homes and libraries, and made things run smoothly behind the scenes as a stage manager and event planner.</p>
<p>Today, you can find me in classrooms, gardens, and public spaces where I use the tools of an artist to start conversations and build community connections. Through inquiry and project based learning I bring stories into new spaces. I meet incredible human beings. I inspire participants to dig into the world that's in front of them. I get inspired by making new connections.</p>
	
<h2><a href="#creative">Creative Facilitation &rarr;</a></h2>
<p>I create photo-emulsion silkscreens and produce a portable screenprinting studio to bring curriculum to life. With over twelve years experience planning and presenting screenprinting experiences for families, artists, youth, and adults with exceptionalities I can guarantee an accessible, connective, and creative experience for your group.</p>
<p>My work as an arts educator is not limited to screenprinting. I have a toolbox of experiential games, teaching tactics, and artist tools that I build into learning arcs. Participants will gain practical experience in teamwork, self esteem and leadership. We practice through shared goal-setting, debriefs, and creating powerful messages together.</p>
<p>I provide budgets, lesson plans, evaluations and volunteer training, and have a roster of skilled co-facilitators and photographers to help me support larger groups. As a mentor, I provide consultation and alternative practicums for teacher candidates or arts educators.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently booking for Fall 2017! Contact me if you&rsquo;d like to learn more.</p>

<h2><a href="#water">Water and Landscape &rarr;</a></h2>
<p>I am one of Kinston&rsquo;s leading experts in managing stormwater runoff as a part of green infrastructure. I love to share my hands-on knowledge of greywater system design, food security, and low impact development. I do this by designing and leading workshops, charettes, and consulting for community groups towards transforming landscapes with new approaches in water management.</p>
<p>Green infrastructure builds on the principles found in nature. In my workshops, participants will see and touch the systems at work and gain a practical understanding in a classroom environment. Participants leave my workshops feeling energized and inspired to put these tools to use. This work is supported by certificates from the Ontario Onsite Wastewater Association, Credit Valley Conservation (LID), Greywater Action, and workplace training from Village Water Services, Phoenix Composting, and Root Radical. Latornell and Grey-to-Green conferences keep me current with best practices and connected to a network of other professionals.</p>
<p>Contact me to book a water-wise gardening workshop this summer!</p>

<h2>Philosophy of Education</h2>
<p>I believe everyone can connect with the most important tool of an artist: creativity. Students want to be seen and heard, however in many environments experience isolation as a result of structural barriers. I create pathways to creativity, a safe container to express opinions, and encouragement to try something new. In these workshops, participants will learn at least one new way to communicate something they know, feel, or believe about the world.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Experiential Learning: Games promote leadership, teamwork, confidence, and creativity, easing our way into the artistic experience. You&rsquo;ll want to add these warm-ups, energizers, and name games to your art-teacher toolbox.</li>
	<li>Inclusive Education: I support participants on the spectrum, and have experience adapting my programs for those with developmental or intellectual disabilities.</li>
	<li>Audience 101: Crafting an effective message starts with thinking of ways to catch the viewers attention&hellip;and keep it.</li>
	<li>All Angles, My Angle: Brainstorming and discussing issues relevant to our community or curriculum helps us see new ways of looking at where we stand.</li>
	<li>DIY Screenprinting: Use squeegees made from cassette tapes, screens made from gauze sheers, and use just tablespoons of water to clean silkscreens. Secondhand materials are a fun way to see sustainability in action and practice budget-conscious habits. Choose from patches, pillowcases, t-shirts or neckties from thrift stores.</li>
	<li>Artist Talk: Hear stories and process behind my fabric art for social change, see samples of patches and neckties.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>In order to make change, I invite people to experience the world in new ways while acknowledging their current position. (PICTURE OF ART OF HOSTING DIAGRAM) Through my study in PYE's Creative Community model, with internationally renowned facilitator Nadia Chaney, I've developed an experiential toolbox to bring groups together across difference. (CF Level 1 &amp; 2 2014, 2015, Community Arts Mentorship, Art of Facilitation 2016) (I CAN ADD HYPERLINKS LATER)</p>
<p>My program &lsquo;Pillow Talk&rsquo; is inspired by the art of Barbara Kruger, Jenny Holzer, and Corita Kent; three of my greatest influences, who use a few words and a single image, frequently from pop culture, as a challenge to the status quo. The beauty of a question or ambiguous statement is that it is a better conversation starter than an antagonistic statement. Conversations are just one way to effect change and should not be considered in isolation.</p>
<p>Recent programs have evolved collaboratively around themes of protest, power, gender, feminism, conflict resolution and mental wellness. These themes all reflect areas of study and artistic exploration in my practice.</p>
	
<h2>Programs</h2>

<div class="programs-left">

	<img src="./img/IMG_1012-500-web.jpg" class="programs">
	<h3>Almost everything you need to know about photo emulsion silkscreens</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Make silkscreens to use within a classroom project, fundraiser, or campaign.</li>
		<li>Building screens helps build tool competencies, body awareness, and teamwork. It is a very empowering process for students who value hands-on learning. Much like a cooking class, we will be stretching/preparing screens (learning about ergonomics, proper tool use, cutting fabric, materials used in screenprinting, and teamwork) and exposing four screens in groups.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Time: 3-4 hrs (CHANGE TO MINUTES?)</p>
	<p>Requirements: Print-ready designs. Prior experience screenprinting. Recommended as an add-on to a Screenprinting Party or Pillow Talk.</p>
	<p>Age: 12+</p>
	
	<img src="./img/mouse-pad2-500-web.jpg" class="programs">
	<h3>Screenprinting Party</h3>
	<p>THIS IS THE BIG DAY! A guaranteed winner with any group, screenprinting parties are a chance for everyone to shine and make their own personalized t-shirt. Great for bands, social justice groups, fundraisers, or team building events.</p>
	<p>Imagination stations (can be run by parent or student volunteers) provide opportunities to sew, add paint/sharpie embellishments, or assemble pillowcases. Make use of the skills you have in your community and create opportunities for connection.</p>
	<p>I make the screens ahead of time in order to allow participants to just focus on creation and connection. Below are details about custom screen fees (screen fees include processing of your images or preparation of images requested by your group):</p>
	<ul>
		<li>$60/screen for 1-4 screens</li>
		<li>$50/screen for 5-10 screens (recommended!)</li>
		<li>$40/screen for 11-25 screens</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Pillow Talk Artist Residency</h3>
	<p>Explore uncomfortable subjects by screenprinting on comfortable objects: pillowcases! In this popular inquiry-based workshop where anyone&rsquo;s an artist, students conceptualize and develop a personalized message for screenprinting. Appropriate topics include but are not limited to mental wellness, social justice, or conflict resolution. By creating our own &lsquo;unanswerable questions&rsquo; we can start a conversation that gets people talking, and creates new neural pathways towards change.</p>
	<p>Curriculum links: NOT ADDED</p>
	<p>Time: Artist residency is 5-8 full days</p>
	<p>Age: Age 12+</p>
	<p>Note: Can be run with two classes concurrently (i.e. full cohort, or grade 7 and 8). Pillow Talk modules consist of design thinking, question development, non-artists becoming artists,  designing with fonts, cut and paste layouts, screen building, screenprinting party, and installation.</p>
