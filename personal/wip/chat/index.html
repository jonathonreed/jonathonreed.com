		Individually we are Jonathon Reed and Asad Chishti; together we make up Chairs and Tables. We&rsquo;ve been collaborating for years and at some point along the line started a company to keep our work under the same umbrella. So far it&rsquo;s helping keep off the rain.

	<h1>Following the Raven &rarr;</h1>
	<p>
		For six months in 2017, we are bicycling 15,000 km across Canada; from the Avalon Peninsula on the Atlantic Ocean, to the Mackenzie Delta near the Arctic, to Vancouver Island in the Pacific. As we cross the country, we will develop an image of Canada as it is today&mdash;a snapshot of the present that provides context from the past in order to create a vision for the future.

	<h1>Introducing Solastalgia &rarr;</h1>
	<p>
		Solastalgia, a digital publication, is an attempt to share a plurality of Canadian perspectives and their individual responses to climate change. Our hope and our vision is that by collecting and amplifying diverse voices from around our country, we can simultaneously get a deeper and wider, more complex and simpler understanding of this crisis that we collectively face.
