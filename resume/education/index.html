	<h1>Jonathon Reed, <i>Teacher</i></h1>
	<h2>Intro - This</h2>
		<p>Before we start, you should know that this is a relatively subjective explanation of a relatively complex and ever-changing web platform. I use Twitter in a pretty specific way that works for me, but all kinds of people use it in all kinds of different ways. I'm not an expert, but I keep an eye on technological developments&mdash;especially in social media. So I'm sharing what I know in the hopes that it will help you find the way <i>you</i> want to use Twitter.</p>
	<h2>The basics</h2>
		<p><b>Username.</b> My username, for example, is <a href="twitter.com/jonathoncomfort">@jonathoncomfort</a>. When you're writing a tweet, anything that is preceded by the @ symbol automatically becomes a link to that Twitter account, and that person gets a notification. If you <i>start</i> a tweet with a username, it only appears in the <a href="https://twitter.com/jonathoncomfort/with_replies">Tweets & replies</a> stream on your profile.</p>
			<blockquote>In this case I tweeted the username <a href="https://twitter.com/younggreenscan">@younggreenscan</a> because I was having a conversation with that Twitter account.
				<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/younggreenscan">@younggreenscan</a> Word! Looking forward to working with <a href="https://twitter.com/KeenanMThomas">@KeenanMThomas</a> for <a href="https://twitter.com/QueensUGreens">@QueensUGreens</a> this fall. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GPC?src=hash">#GPC</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/cdnpoli?src=hash">#cdnpoli</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/elxn42?src=hash">#elxn42</a></p>&mdash; Jonathon Reed (@jonathoncomfort) <a href="https://twitter.com/jonathoncomfort/status/595914581018423296">May 6, 2015</a></blockquote></blockquote>
			<blockquote>In this case I tweeted the username <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeHudema">@MikeHudema</a> because he wrote the article, and he has a large Twitter audience, so I wanted him to see that I had shared his writing. You can see it doesn't have the same conversational element, but it did get his attention.
				<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-cards="hidden" lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We&#39;ve had enough of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Harper?src=hash">#Harper</a> working for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/oil?src=hash">#oil</a> companies instead of our collective future. <a href="http://t.co/SpYc2E7yOE">http://t.co/SpYc2E7yOE</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeHudema">@MikeHudema</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/tarsands?src=hash">#tarsands</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NoTPP?src=hash">#NoTPP</a></p>&mdash; Jonathon Reed (@jonathoncomfort) <a href="https://twitter.com/jonathoncomfort/status/591478960636039169">April 24, 2015</a></blockquote></blockquote>
			<blockquote>Some people put a period in front of the username at the start of the tweet in order to ensure it stays in the main Twitter stream. I personally don't do this but it is acceptable Twitter grammar.
				<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-cards="hidden" lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/TIME">@TIME</a> has chosen 350&#39;s <a href="https://twitter.com/mayboeve">@mayboeve</a> as a &quot;next generation leader&quot; - we may be biased, but we think she&#39;s great too <a href="http://t.co/jik8jkuUSz">http://t.co/jik8jkuUSz</a></p>&mdash; 350 dot org (@350) <a href="https://twitter.com/350/status/604316525206589440">May 29, 2015</a></blockquote></blockquote>
		<p><b>Hashtag.</b> Any word in a tweet that is preceded by a # symbol becomes a link to a collection of all the tweets that include that hashtag. An example would be the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&q=%23cdnpoli">#cdnpoli</a>. Hashtags can be general words like <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&q=%23climate">#climate</a> or specific terms like <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&q=%23elxn42">#elxn42</a>. The hashtag search page can be filtered by most popular tweets, live updates, photos, videos, etc. You can't use symbols in hashtags.</p>
			<blockquote>In this case I used four different hashtags to connect my tweet to four different national conversations: climate change, the tar sands industry, the NDP and the Alberta election. Hashtags can be either in the body of the tweet or added onto the end.
				<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-cards="hidden" lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Time to push for action on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/climatechange?src=hash">#climatechange</a>: Alberta <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/tarsands?src=hash">#tarsands</a> now in uncharted waters with <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NDP?src=hash">#NDP</a> premier <a href="http://t.co/shMmsuj31Y">http://t.co/shMmsuj31Y</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/abvote?src=hash">#abvote</a></p>&mdash; Jonathon Reed (@jonathoncomfort) <a href="https://twitter.com/jonathoncomfort/status/595911624281628672">May 6, 2015</a></blockquote></blockquote>
			<blockquote>Some hashtags are very current and refer to specific campaigns or movements. In this case, the direct action in Seattle pushed the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ShellNo?src=hash">#ShellNo</a> to gain and consolidate media attention. It's sometimes hard to figure out which hashtag would be related to the issue you're tweeting about; my only advice would be to look around on other people's Twitter pages or in online news.
				<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-cards="hidden" lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&#39;<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ShellNo?src=hash">#ShellNo</a>&#39;: Hundreds take to boats in Seattle to protest Arctic drilling - next is the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/shellagm?src=hash">#shellagm</a> <a href="http://t.co/IPNTkTo7Na">http://t.co/IPNTkTo7Na</a></p>&mdash; UK Tar Sands Network (@NoTarSands) <a href="https://twitter.com/NoTarSands/status/599821877025071104">May 17, 2015</a></blockquote></blockquote>
		<p><b>Retweet.</b> Every tweet can be retweeted, which is essentially just reposting it to your followers. It appears inline in your Twitter stream. I do this a lot because it's a lot easier and takes less time than writing my own tweets.</p>
			<blockquote>A new development is quoting a tweet, which is similar to retweeting but allows you to add your own commentary. When you click the retweet button, you have the option to add your own comment, which means you will post your own tweet with the original tweet embedded underneath. (It doesn't show up correctly when I embed it here, so click the tweet to view it on Twitter.)
				<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">They can&#39;t be serious with this one. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NoKXL?src=hash">#NoKXL</a> <a href="https://t.co/ydROmUMGDv">https://t.co/ydROmUMGDv</a></p>&mdash; David Turnbull (@david_turnbull) <a href="https://twitter.com/david_turnbull/status/602863769291661312">May 25, 2015</a></blockquote></blockquote>
		<p><b>Direct message.</b> A direct message is a private message sent to a single account. In most cases, you can only send a direct message to someone that follows you. However, it is possible for users to opt-in to receiving direct messages from anyone.</p>
	<h2>Outdated things</h2>
		<p><b>Link shorteners.</b> Shortening a full URL isn't necessary anymore since Twitter automatically truncates them (and adds an ellipsis at the end). I don't like link shorteners because I think it's proper etiquette for people to be able to see what the link is.</p>
			<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-cards="hidden" lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">26 European mayors representing more than 60 million inhabitants sign <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/climatechange?src=hash">#climatechange</a> statement in support of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/COP21?src=hash">#COP21</a> <a href="http://t.co/axbbRxwsyK">http://t.co/axbbRxwsyK</a></p>&mdash; UNFCCC (@UNFCCC) <a href="https://twitter.com/UNFCCC/status/581084275069624320">March 26, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
		<p><b>RT and MT.</b> They stand for retweet and modified retweet respectively, but they were the precursors to the retweet and quote tweet capabilities. Still sometimes useful but kind of old-school.</p>
			<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-cards="hidden" lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We&#39;re running out of time. MT <a href="https://twitter.com/StephenLeahy">@StephenLeahy</a> Our global carbon budget will be fully allocated in 2018. <a href="http://t.co/F3IGERF3rG">http://t.co/F3IGERF3rG</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/climatechange?src=hash">#climatechange</a></p>&mdash; Jonathon Reed (@jonathoncomfort) <a href="https://twitter.com/jonathoncomfort/status/588322555875856384">April 15, 2015</a></blockquote>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>I get news on climate, tar sands industries and Canadian politics from Twitter, I connect with fellow activists on Twitter and coordinate/support protests and other justice campaigning on Twitter. That's what I want out of this platform and it's only possible because I've put in the time and effort to follow the right accounts and connect to the right community. A lot of people don't want to or don't know how to do that and end up abandoning Twitter. So I'm conscious that it works for me because I've invested into it.</p>
		<p>I value quality over quantity in the tweets that I post, so each tweet takes quite a bit of time to get right. My tweets are almost always links to articles. If there's a concise, impactful quote from the article, I consider including it. If the title is explanatory, I consider including it. If there's relevant hashtags or accounts that would be useful or help the tweet get attention, I consider including them. I don't have any specific advice about writing tweets other than keep it short and sweet&mdash;it's micromedia.</p>
