	<h1 id="spring">Spring</h1>
	<p>A mix of indie folk bands for hearts longing for summertime: James Vincent McMorrow, Release the Sunbird, The Antlers & others. Set to the endless rhythm of cicadas in sunbeat fields, the wild beauty of forests in the wind & the vastness of clouds racing across the sky. These melodies will wrap themselves in a hundred memories.</p>

	<h1 id="summer">Summer</h1>
	<p>A mix to match the heaviness of winter and the soft sadness of early almost-light mornings, featuring musicians like Angus & Julia Stone, James Vincent McMorrow and Noah Gundersen, These songs will whisper the promise of summer, a hint of birdsong under the cracking ice and cold winds. Every day that passes is longer than the last, and soon enough the sun will be here to stay.</p>

	<h1 id="autumn">Autumn</h1>
	<p>A playlist for cold mornings and falling leaves, for the days when you can feel a chill in the air and the sun doesn’t trail her fingers across your skin quite like she used to. Take a moment, find that cup of tea and old familiar sweater, and let the songs of Roo Panes, Old Man Canyon and Alexi Murdoch hold you until the warm days come again.</p>
