	<p>I&rsquo;m a certified teacher and long-time summer camp head counsellor. I speak with young people easily and I err on the side of the dramatic.	Because my background is in education, I&rsquo;m collaborative and flexible as a speaker. My presentations can be as interactive or as traditional as you want, whether it&rsquo;s just a portion of a class or a school-wide assembly. Get in contact with me and we&rsquo;ll give your students something to remember.</p>

	<h2 class="padding-top-1rem padding-bottom-1rem heavy uppercase">Climate Activism</h2>
	<h3>&ldquo;I refuse to do nothing.&rdquo; &mdash; My old longboard deck</h3>
	<p>For students studying climate change and democracy. I connect youth-led movements throughout history to the the growing pattern of youth taking action in the face of the climate crisis. I share stories from my experience in the climate movement&mdash;getting tear gassed at the Paris Agreement, being arrested on the steps of Parliament Hill, bicycling 15,000 km across Canada to some of the places most threatened by climate change&mdash;to engage students and empower them to work together to make positive change in their communities, and to become the climate leaders we so desperately need.</p>
	
	<h2 class="padding-bottom-1rem heavy uppercase">Adventure</h2>
	<h3>&ldquo;Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?&rdquo; &mdash; Mary Oliver</h3>
	<p>For students in outdoor education or at a transition point in their lives. I present my philosophy of &lsquo;doing&rsquo; happy rather than &lsquo;being&rsquo; happy, following my habit of writing down the best part of every day from the French Alps to the deserts of Utah to my own backyard. I combine candid stories, award-winning photography and practical advice to motivate students to dream big and follow through. Students come away with inspiration and intentionality&mdash;to find what they love, and pursue it with purpose.</p>

	<h2 class="padding-bottom-1rem heavy uppercase">Masculinity</h2>
	<h3>&ldquo;The time has come for us to allow boys to craft this new, far more flexible code of manhood.&rdquo; &mdash; William Pollack</h3>
	<p class="final">For boys. Depending on students&rsquo; experiences, I talk about the hierarchy of masculinity, the unwritten rules of boy culture, societal expectations of traditional masculinity and how these things impact boys&rsquo; self-identities and relationships with others. Homophobia, emotional literacy, body image, sexual health, etc. I use my credibility as an athletic young man to guide boys towards a culture of compassion and support, a culture  that celebrates both strength and gentleness and affirms their masculinity without making them prove it.
